{# attribute_description_prompt.j2 #}
{% set attribute_list = attributes | join(', ') %}
{% set description_list = descriptions | join(', ') %}

Here are the precise names of each attribute: {{ attribute_list }}.
Refer to these exact names when asked for the attribute names.
It is imperative you use every single attribute in the output table; do not leave any out.

Here are descriptions of each attribute, in the same order: {{ description_list }}.

Use the descriptions alongside other knowledge to answer the following question for the purposes of this research project.
For the research, it is needed that you make a best guess on how an intelligent, reasonable person would answer this survey question, even if you are unsure.

Give your complete attention to the entirety of the {{ object_category }} passage;
do not simply over‑weigh the beginning or end of the passage. This would be very unscientific.

This is the passage:

BEGINNING OF PASSAGE. NOTHING BEFORE THIS IS PART OF PASSAGE.

{{ passage }}

END OF PASSAGE. NOTHING AFTER THIS IS PART OF PASSAGE.

On a scale of 0‑100, rate how much the {{ object_category }} passage manifests the
{{ attribute_category }} attributes of {{ attribute_list }}.
