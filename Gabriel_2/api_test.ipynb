    "I’m just going to get started. I just want to say thanks for taking the time to talk to me today as I'm conducting research around cloud-native security software vendors. Do you have experience with vendors like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I work with the cloud-native security vendors like all the time. It depends on which layer of the stack. What is the purpose that they're serving, but yes, I work with a lot of vendors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever worked with vendors like Palo Alto Networks, Aqua Security, Orca?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "I worked with the Palo Alto Network, I worked with Orca in my previous jobs, I have heard of Aqua, but I have not used them, yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the most recent example of a buying initiative you've been involved in when it came to just evaluating cloud security products like that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent example would be like cloud security posture management overall for my current company and my previous company, where we look at two things. Cloud security posture management looking at what’s the security posture of all of our cloud assets, network applications, infrastructure, all of that.\n",
    "From a scanning perspective, we need to look at like Orca security, for example, has a container scanning solution. Both from a security scanning perspective to detect security vulnerabilities and also from what you call cloud security posture management to check against some security best practices configurations and to identify deviations from those configurations and so on and so forth. These are the two things that I have been involved in pretty recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever been involved or even just an evaluator or an influencer? I noticed you have it looks like a specialization in compliance. I'm really interested in that. I'm curious if you have purchased anything recently to secure either containers or VMs besides the CSPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides CSPM, let me think about it. I have evaluated a bunch of products. There was a product called CloudKnox, which recently got acquired by Microsoft, which was a container security play.\n",
    "I also looked at evaluating a scanning vendor. A container scanning vendor. I don't even remember these names. I have a couple of Israeli companies that got introduced me through Will Ventures who are into container-level scanning and all of that stuff. I am constantly in these conversations, yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome. Do you think you can tell me then about your current environment? How you are securing workload, we'll just start with how do you secure workloads, specifically VMs and containers, where you are now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, VMs and containers, where we are now? When you're saying secured it from an architecture perspective or from a prevention perspective or from a detection perspective?\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "I think there are a few things here. The first is before you deploy your containers into production, then you need to make sure that your build-time scans are running appropriately. You need to have a build-time scanning solution, so that you detect all the vulnerabilities through which deploying your applications through containers in your production environment before you deploy that to detect all of that.\n",
    "We have a build-time scanning solution then once the build-time piece is taken care of, then we also have a runtime solution. Where when these workloads are running during runtime to detect deviations, the best practices, and all of that stuff. There's build-time scanning, runtime scanning, and then also when these container images are getting baked in the source as well, like when they are getting actually baked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are you using to secure that build-time and that runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "I can't give you the name of the tools. I'm a security practitioner. I can give you some popular tools that are in the market that do this. But I can't tell you because then I am exposing my entire security stack externally, I can't do that, sorry about that.\n",
    "I have used Evident.io in the past, they got acquired by Palo Alto Networks. I've used Aqua Security as well. Aqua Security, there's somebody that I worked with very closely came up with a product called CloudSploit, which got acquired by Aqua Security that does exactly this functionality, right, scanning containers and all of that during build-time.\n",
    "CloudKnox is again another popular kind of vendor recently got acquired by Microsoft, who is in this space as well, but haven't used them. To answer your question, honestly, there are only two vendors that I have directly used from an implementation practitioner perspective as Aqua and Evident.io.\n",
    "I know a lot of other vendors in the space, are also talking about the same thing. I have a lot of peers in the industry that use Lacework and they are also talking about container scanning and securing your workloads during build-time, runtime and all of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you hear about this CNDR eBPF-based technology that Aqua Security released with the latest version? It’s security incident detection and response with the cloud DNA. Offered by Aqua in addition to everything else. Now you've had prevention, but you need like Aqua, maybe they didn't provide as strong as robust of an offering in terms of detection and response.\n",
    "So now, they prevent, they detect, and they can respond. The detection is based on eBPF technology, which has been pretty interesting. I was just curious if you had heard about that and because that's what I'm doing research on specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "You're basically talking about auto-remediation. Auto-remediation and healing kind of capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "They’re not fully that, but when we're going through and I need my picture in front of me to know this. When you're going through the stages of incident response previously, Aqua didn't have a product for every single stage of that, and now they do. I think they offer their own incidence response tool but built for the cloud. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Just give me your perspective on Aqua, that would be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "I can talk to that. When I was using Aqua, my primary focus was I looked at it from a compliance angle. Now for PCI, you need to have scanning. You have a build-time scan, you have a runtime scan. You need to have a mechanism to detect vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "I think your compliance knowledge would be so incredibly helpful for me in this right now because I am also in the compliance domain. As much as I can marry kind of what we do with requirements and stuff in a snazzy way is good. Walk me through it, what's typically required when it comes to securing a container in a compliant way?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I think there are two things that you need to look at. I'll talk about three domains. Asset management, configuration management, and vulnerability management. These are the three things. Now the first one is asset management. You need to make sure that you have full coverage of your assets in production.\n",
    "You need to make sure that you're deploying whatever containers to production in a way that you can track it, absolutely. You need to have an agent base or an agentless system that is centrally kind of pulling up your resources and giving you a good inventory of your assets and so on and so forth. That's asset management, that one of the primary reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this PCI compliance, particularly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "No. I'm kind of generalizing this for you. That I'm talking about is access management, change management and access management, configuration management, and vulnerability management are applicable across everything, like SOC 2, PCI, ISO, HIPAA, anything. I've worked with every compliant pretty much. It's across the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Cool, keep going on that. Asset management is ensuring you have full coverage of assets in production, having some kind of agentless, agent-based system, pulling up your resources, and inventorying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Then the next one is once you have a good inventory of your assets and you know where your assets are, you've got to protect them. There are a few things. You've got to bake your containers with the best practice security configurations.\n",
    "This could be like CIS best practices. It could be some other best practice configuration that you need to make sure that these are containers that kind of buttoned-up and hardened in a way that there are no kind of open core services running and like the services that are running are specific to your business need and so on and so forth. That is around hardening.\n",
    "You need to make sure that they're hardened from a configuration perspective. Then once you harden them and then you deploy them to production, then you need to make sure that the desired state that you achieved to hardening is not being deviated. You need to have a mechanism to identify any deviations from that desired hard and straight.\n",
    "You need to have a configuration monitoring solution running to identify deviations from that desired state from a container configuration perspective. I spoke about asset management and configuration management. Let me talk about vulnerability management. Now once these containers are deployed into production, and then you have your applications running on these containers, you need to make sure that you have a mechanism to detect vulnerabilities on these containers.\n",
    "Then so you need a scanning engine to perform those vulnerability stands and notify you and you need to fix those vulnerabilities based on the severity of risk within predefined SLA that your company has, if it's a critical vulnerability, you need to fix it within whatever two days or 30 days, high risk, 60 days, medium-risk, 90 days.\n",
    "I mean it depends on what your company defines. All of that stuff. I covered access management, vulnerability management, configuration management. Another critical domain from a compliance perspective is change management as well.\n",
    "You need to make sure that the changes that you're making to your infrastructure, which is your containers, applications and so on and so forth after this is deployed into production, follows an overall change management process, making sure the right level of approval is being tracked, the right level of testing happen, the right level of monitoring around those changes and all of that.\n",
    "Access management, you need to make sure that the access is restricted to need to know, and the business need only basis, and then you have a process to perform quarterly access reviews and then all of that. I touched on the five-key domains, configuration management, vulnerability management, change management, access controls, and then finally, monitoring as well.\n",
    "The last piece I would like to round this off with like the monitoring. You need to make sure that you have a mechanism to monitor any malicious activity on your platform and your container environment. Then once you identify, you need to have a mechanism of triage and then identify it's like a security kind of a breach or something like that, you need to have IR and SOC process to detect all of that.\n",
    "These are some of the key elements from a compliance perspective. I'm extrapolating it to a level where I mean, if you look at PCI, they have like specific requirements or change management towards SOC 2 has specific requirements. The way I explained this to you is a very general and holistic overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that's perfect. I was asking for actually. Then I have a few questions based on that. One is, were you involved in the buying process for Aqua?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "I had influence over it. I didn't pay the bills though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have any takeaways or anything you remember in terms of compliance there? Where did they fall short or stronger than competitors at the time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "I think one of the challenges I remember that the team had was the issues from scanning. I mean there would be like hundreds and thousands of issues. So one of the issues we didn't have enough resources to fix all those issues. I'm sure you folks have probably gotten better with that, like the triaging. That is one area where I feel like, as an industry, there's a lot of room for improvement for security.\n",
    "Practitioners are so scarce. It's hard to kind of find talented people these days in the market. I think if the security vendors who can actually give valuable real insight around vulnerabilities and all of that, right, are actually the ones that are going to take the market in my opinion.\n",
    "Aqua is great. I think they are one of the first to think about container scanning and all of that. I remember this. And all of these new players are coming now. I really don't know how the status is right now overall. I haven't evaluated it in the recent past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "What other compliance requirements are important where you are now, which is TripActions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. It's the same thing as SOC 2, ISO, PCI, SOC 1 are all critical. Those are some of the frameworks we’re looking at. There will be more though. This is a growing business, so there will be more requirements that we need to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Can you tell me maybe on a high-level way how you currently detect runtime workload attacks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a lot of monitoring capabilities. We have tools that are running to detect malicious API calls to our production infrastructure, web application calls to our production infrastructure. We have lot of scanning tools that are also constantly kind of running in our production infrastructure to provide some valuable insights based on the triaging we are performing. We monitor that web application layer, API layer, infrastructure layer, also from infrastructure layer, security groups and all of that.\n",
    "Constantly, the traffic that is getting flown through these elements, the traffic that is getting flown through our API gateway, we monitor that as well. I can't give you specific tooling, but we have tooling at each layer of the stack pretty much and all of these layers to kind of detect kind of malicious behavior overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you currently respond to workload attacks? If it ever happens to you, you can tell me about that, if not theoretically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, the way it would work is we have alerting. We have 24/7 monitoring, both from an SRE perspective and from a security perspective, they are constantly watching. If there's an attack, of course, the ultimate call to kind of raise an incident or any of that nature would kind of belong to our person who leads our IR and SOC function. This all gets routed to our IR function through our SIEM solution through SRE and other mechanisms and then that's where it gets evaluated. That is how it happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Getting into the specifics, what do you see as the key compliance requirement differences between securing a VM and securing a container?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Securing VM versus securing container. The thing about containers, if I recall, it's been a while since I kind of dug deep into that space, right, VM is standard. It's like a server. You need to harden it and then you need to have an agent running to detect any deviation from the hardened state, and then you need to have remediation fixes.\n",
    "Now the container is a whole different ball game because once you deploy a container into production, you're going to be running your application on top of that. It becomes absolutely critical. If you look at most of the attack vectors, it happened through the application layer. I think the key risk element there is when you're building your infrastructure, you need to make sure that there are no vulnerabilities in your container through which your application can be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some of the ways you could do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the ways you can actually do that is this is where humans coming into play is and maybe some tools like Aqua can help in the future to contextualize your application. Look at the risk at your container layer, when you're baking your containers in the context of your application. For example, TripActions is a travel platform, whereas Adobe is design solutions.\n",
    "Contextualizing your application and your business in the context of looking at risk when you're baking your infrastructure upright. This is the piece where researchers come into play, like app check researchers and cloud security researchers and so on and so forth there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there things specific to VMs and PCI, for example, like that or any kind of compliance things that outlined specifically how VM needs to be secured to be to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. PCI, it has very specific requirements around some hardening, around some ports and protocols that need to be closed versus open. Like PCI is a hard requirement saying that your CDE, cardholder data environment or if there is a server or the VM that is actually hosting an application, which is part of your cardholder data environment information.\n",
    "This application or the server cannot be exposed to the Internet. What I mean by that is if you're having a VM on which you have like a PCI application running, you can't have port 80 open. There are many such examples of PCI, hard requirements that are exposing the application to the Internet and so on and so forth there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Aqua is CNAPP, which is a new Gartner category, cloud-native application protection platform. It subsumes like I actually have it right here with me like every vendor in the space from Gartner. CNAPP includes build security. It includes workload security. It's kind of the whole thing. It's a platform that provides end-to-end life cycle security. CNAPP is a cloud-native application protection platform.\n",
    "It was just recently, I mean, this year coined by Gartner. Previously, yes, and it subsumes actually to give you a better answer, what they did is they combined their shift left DevSecOps products type of capabilities, intelligent automation, CSPM and CWPPs and they put them all together and say, that's that category.\n",
    "The first element is full life cycle risk classification. This means understanding the meaning of a piece of information based on where it is seen in relation to other information. It necessarily involves two things: one, sharing context from across the full life cycle build to workloads, infrastructure to workloads, and more.\n",
    "Second, integration points at key places in the cloud-native architecture, for example, admission controllers, CI/CD pipeline, workload protection specific to manage Kubernetes platforms that don't know allow access to the host. This gives you the most complete version of the truth. That's kind of the first, maybe I think of it in terms of like pillar of what Aqua or how Aqua works? Any thoughts on that so far?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, the takeaway there was the context. You spoke about like basically advocating all the information and getting some context and then providing the context of where the risks are. That's my takeaway based on what you described. It made sense to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to move on to the next section. That's the first piece, right? And then you also get a shared source of truth across developers, security and operations teams, possibly based on 2 things.\n",
    "For example, a shared risk model for dev and security teams for CVEs, plug-ins for CSPM and visibility across child-cloud service accounts, et cetera. And second, shared policies to govern pipeline and runtime responses. What are your thoughts on that? I can maybe explain that a little more if you need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense. I like the first two on the better because there's too many. I just feel like there's like too many shared. If you can figure out a way to kind of replace shared with something else, a little more meaningful. That might make more sense from a practitioner's viewpoint if that makes sense to you, what I'm saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "But having a shared source of truth across teams in concept, is that important to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on the state of the company, to be very honest with you. If it is a company where there are like 300 people, the lines between SRE and security are blurry, then absolutely important, okay. There's no question.\n",
    "I think this is what these kinds of folks need. Let's take an example of Adobe, where typically, SRE doesn't talk to security, there's a different kind of engagement model there than it may not be. It just depends on the dynamics of the organization company and how teams are structured and leadership and all of that in my opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a shared risk model for dev and security teams for CVEs. I mean, isn't that valuable? It seems like the standardization there could have some value!\n",
    "There has to be an upside of consistency and standardization. Like shared languages across all of these platforms when you're managing a CVE or the alternatively kind of a shared risk model between dev and security teams isn't that interesting. Shared policies to govern pipelines and runtime responses. So the ability for all three of those teams to set up policies because this is one unified platform, all of these teams just use that to get everything done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "These teams are talking to each other. It all again, depends on the engagement. It's definitely, as I said, a company-by-company thing, it would be definitely important to have a shared level of visibility in some companies. In others, not necessarily the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "How important is it to most companies to have it because that is a powerful thing, to have a shared like essentially data model? I mean how important is that kind of consistency and frictionless interaction. I think maybe the shared source of truth isn't necessarily hitting the mark in my opinion. It sounds like that's what you're saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. The third point is that because this whole new CNAPP Aqua platform that has everything you could ever need, including runtime detection response. We offer automated granular response because visibility is worthless without a subsequent response mechanism to fix the problem. We don't just leave you to it, although we know a lot of people do have teams for it. With Aqua, you can automatically respond to blind spots and active issues and respond granularly without downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I think without downtime becomes a critical aspect, because any engineering leader wouldn't want an automated response because what if that brings the platform down or something. Without downtime, that's the question that's going to come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. You're saying engineering leaders might not want an automated response?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on what you have preconfigured. You have preconfigured rules saying that these are the kind of issues. This is the automated response. If there is a new issue, for example, nobody would want an automated response because it's scary. You do an automated response in production. Then what if that kind of messes up something else, and then that leads to like incident or downtime or something for your app, right, so yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "That makes sense, yes. It's more nuanced than that and so that's something people will work through, they also offer real-time protection, and they truly believe they are the only ones in the market that can actually stop an attack in progress before like a workload runtime attack. Aqua can detect it and shut it down immediately. That would just be happening to the specific container that was spun up. Then you could just spin the container back up, right? In some situations, it seems like it's okay. For a zero-day attack on a container, how problematic is this an automated response to something like that because containers are so different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it, if their application that is kind of serving your customers running on those containers. Then what happens to that, right? What is the response and creates a situation on the application and you don't want that to have any negative impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, if it's a runtime attack, it was missed. Theoretically, if it's a zero-day attack and runtime, static scanning, and everything else missed it. There's a possibility it's like once you destroy that container, and then spin it back up, the problem is completely gone, right?\n",
    "If it wasn't some existing malware, like if you know you had a clean image or a build clean image. Then in runtime, this container has been running, and it's fine, and then all of a sudden, you detect an attack in your environment, maybe like minimally appropriate automated responses at least like to quarantine or to block or delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Compliance and Assurance at TripActions\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimally appropriate automated responses make sense. Some things won't apply to a zero-day because zero-day is a new situation. You know what I'm saying. Minimally appropriate automated response for the zero-day. I would like to understand more like what exactly is that response is going to look like? What is it going to impact? How will it impact my application?\n",

    "Exactly, yes. So we have 1 sixth grade teacher, 1 seventh grade ELA teacher. And then we have 2 eighth grade ELA teachers. They have 2 because one of them is sort of in this role that is, she's the Department Chair but also the mentor teacher for our school, so she has to do observations and mentor teachers throughout her day. So she has a smaller schedule for any 2 teachers in that role.\n",

But the DOE is kind of unique because I've taught in DC Public School, Durham Public School in North China, Oakland Unified and the DOE.\n",
    "And the DOE is the only real district that is set up like this. And I think it is truly just because of the number of schools that are in it. So specific with District 6, it's just 1 single district with, you might be broken into like high schools or middle schools, but very rarely are you subdivided into the district.\n",

    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",

    "We have to be because of the pandemic. I don't think they were before. Like we had to get quite a few devices. When the pandemic hit, the DOE offered like, I think 200,000 or 300,000. I've had in my school, I've noted many, many of the children have them. So that says to me that we didn't have enough devices for every kid to take home.\n",
    "But we use Google Classroom as our current LMS, and that was primarily adopted by all tutors when we shifted to remote. It wasn't necessarily used by all teachers prior to it. But school is an interesting one. It's a screened middle school.\n",
    "I'm not sure if you're familiar with how the DOE does middle and high school, but the DOE basically allows for anyone to kind of apply to any middle school or any high school that you want. And then each of the middle schools and high schools have a set of criteria that they use to choose students or to allow students in or prioritize students.\n",
    "And my school is actually one of the academically screened middle schools in Highland, and it is sort of like the pride of the Dominican community. So it is like very much a place that parents want their kids to go. And so you get 2 sort of dynamics there.\n",
    "You've got like students who had like a placement test, but also like their standardized test scores from lower elementary grades count. And then there's sort of behavior thing, which I think is a little bit just a weird way to say that they try to pick students who are seen as motivated, whatever that means.\n",
    "But because of that, primarily, our teaching staff is one of the older teaching staff that I've seen in schools, like I normally I'm used to having being surrounded by a lot of younger teachers and that sort of thing, but because this is a school where it's seen as students are pretty motivated and it's screened, it's been kind of a study at ease. So you've got teachers who are very much kind of in their way.\n",

    "I've used it all year. I've shared it with my Department Chair and a couple of the other teachers have dabbled in it, but I've been using it for the entire year and then pretty early on, the Department Chair started using it as well. So there are about 2 of us who are using it to some amount regularly and then one of the teachers is just resistant to anything new. And the other one has switched grades and is overwhelmed. So she hasn't really adopted this kind of stuff.\n",

    "\n",
    "So I'm using i-Ready for diagnostics, and I'll use that when occasionally as like a resource. For my blended schedule, the way that, that works is I'll have my A day class in person with me and then my B day class, I have to create a 45-minute lesson that they do completely without me. And so I'll use i-Ready sparingly to assign, like if there's a skill that I just want them to practice, I'll do that.\n",
    "So like the other day, I did a summarizing, just in time a random lesson on summarizing, but primarily, i-Ready has been used as a diagnostic, and that is offered, I think, I want to say the district provided, I don't know that our school bought i-Ready. And then I use Newsela to bring in informational text into my novels.\n",

    "The district does not. So I use the free version of that. I don't think my school has historically spent money on technology like program, online programs. So all of this stuff is, I'm using the free version of, except for i-Ready, which I guess the district paid for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes sense. And what's the use case for NoRedInk today in the classroom? I know you're using the free version. But is it, hey, this is a homework assignment? Or hey, we're doing this in class? Like how are we using NoRedInk in the COVID world?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "So I love NoRedInk in particular. And the reason I was drawn to even work there is I tried to use it prior to working as well. But the mastery based component is really powerful. So the students cannot move on to the past skill unless they master it. And mastery is defined, like if you get one wrong, you have to kind of go back and relearn. So for me, it's really powerful.\n",
    "And as a teacher, when you can't provide that individual lot of instruction, if you think about grammar, or any of these sort of writing skills, they just need to practice, filling out a worksheet and then migrating it later, the feedback with this is too long. They forget why they put a comma where they put it, they don't have any tutor, like it's just such a powerful tool for that practice piece and that's just for the grammar.\n",
    "I've also been using some of their writing tools that they've been working on as well. But the way that we use it in my class is I gave them a diagnostic at the beginning of the year and sort of assessed some of the big skills that I know, writing-wise, most seventh graders struggle there.\n",
    "And at first, I did it weekly, where on Monday, I'd introduce a skill, like commas, for example, like you're combining 2 clauses with a comma. So I do many lesson on that, and then they would have 4 days to practice it, either I give them 15 minutes in class here and there, but they'd have 15 minutes to complete the practice, which is mastery based. And then on Friday, they would have a quiz.\n",
    "And so that's how I used it every week, and then I moved to every other week just because we're hitting walls and we're really overwhelmed with everything. And so my curriculum had to slow down quite a bit. But I use it either based on the diagnostic as I select those skills or I will assign a big writing assignment, like we had our argumentative essay.\n",
    "And I noticed that students are really struggling with fragments. And so I immediately go to NoRedInk. I created a week-long unit on fragments and then give them a quiz, and then I have them go back to their writing and fix it based on what they've learned. So that's sort of how I incorporate it. I've used their Quick Write as well, those can be really helpful.\n",

    "What's a Quick Write?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Writes were basically, they'll either have a pre-set prompt where you can set a word count and then you assign it and the kids go in, you give them 5 minutes and they type as much as they can and respond to the prompt. I did one where it's sort of a skill-based Quick Write.\n",
    "So they had this article about frogs that they had to combine short simple sentences and rewrite the paragraph by combining short simple sentences and adding coordinating conjunctions. So I really liked those more skill-based ones, but for the Quick Write, I just haven't spent as much time learning about what they can and can't do. And so I use that primarily for the grammar practice as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "So most of our use case is grammar today. Is that the right way to think about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, grammar and writing. The writing, I think it's kind of hard to separate the two, really. When I'm giving feedback as a teacher, I'm really looking, especially in middle school, where you've got so many problems with writing, like what I want to give them, you have to make feedback very unbiased, right, to fix this one thing. This one thing is really good, this one thing is the effect.\n",
    "And my goal in seventh grade is to prepare them for a script writing. So in seventh grade, I'm really focusing on things like the structure of their writing, how are they organizing their writing and an argument should have a claim and evidence and can they provide context and then explain how that evidence proves your claim. Same with like writing summaries, like are you providing a quick summary and then using transition words, like those sorts of things.\n",
    "So when I'm giving them written feedback on their writing, I want to be able to say, tighten up your claim or your evidence isn't super relevant. But it's impossible to ignore that they haven't really been taught a lot of the foundations of grammar. And so what I do is I sort of like supplement or use NoRedInk as a way to correct some of that stuff that I don't want to focus in on the feedback.\n",
    "I think that they can only really tolerate 1 or 2 pieces of big writing feedback. So I'll gather the data from all of different paragraphs assigned, them in their writings and then I'm hitting both of those needs, the structural sort of the meat plus the bones. And then I have them correct it, revise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "So the let me regurgitate that back because that's super helpful. You're saying you can't separate writing from grammar. You primarily work with seventh grade students, is that correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. And I think they're all seventh graders right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "They're all seventh graders. And so what you're saying is, look, NoRedInk will actually divorce grammar from writing, even though you can't, but the way you get to divorce it is by focusing on the grammar through NoRedInk, which eventually, hopefully, influences how they write. And so if NoRedInk's grammar exercises are the bones, the writing that I'm assuming they're also getting to complete, to some extent on NoRedInk, are they completing writing exercises on NoRedInk when they do it digitally? Or is that more happening on Google Docs?\n",
    "I'm just like trying to understand like where does like grammar exercises, it seems like lives on NoRedInk. But then once they learn that grammar and then want to put that to use, is that writing being done in Google Docs? Or is that writing being done on NoRedInk?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. It's primarily the writing. When we're doing any sort of chunky media assignment, I've been using Slides a lot, Google Slides for writing just because for teaching remotely, you can press a bunch of slides, and you can kind of monitor them all at the same time. But yes, they're doing a lot of their writing.\n",
    "And it's sort of like I use their piece of writing to diagnose, I sign it on Classroom or on NoRedInk so that they actually master it. And then what I can do then is the way that I'll use my rubrics, for example, because I use rubrics to grade writing as I can then add a little line in the rubric where if I've taught you commas, for example, if we've done 4 or 5 weeks of practice on commas with NoRedInk, I can then add a piece of my rubric that says like comma usage. And then I can grade them.\n",
    "And then instead of me spending time, this is what happens at the beginning of the year is you're like, well, I can't really read your writings, because it's all fragments and they're like what's a fragment, right? So if I'm teaching them the skills on their writing and they're practicing it, they're building their academic vocabulary, which is really critical in seventh grade, they're also understanding how to find and diagnose.\n",
    "And I think what's interesting, and this is old school. So like 6 years ago, a lot of the grammar and writing software out there, including i-Ready, this is very much like A, B, C, D, right? So you'll have this sentence provided to you and then it'll say, which of these options is correct? And students will have to figure out which of those is commas.\n",
    "And I actually find that sometimes I'm exposing them to so many different wrong answers and just like multiple choice idea, you don't really get to an authentic understanding of the skill, whereas in writing, because of the way that it is made, they can drag and drop a comma anywhere. It mimics the choices they make when they're writing.\n",
    "They can capitalize anywhere, they can drag and drop a comma anywhere. So it's a much more authentic assessment of their understanding. And everybody I've ever showed it to is like, oh, wow, this is different, right?\n",
    "Because they've historically not really loved resources because it's like, okay, cool, here's this comma, A, B, C or D, and it could be used and then they give up and then it's like not really that helpful. So because it's mastery based and because the way that the program is designed in that you can make a bunch of different changes, you really do assess the student's skill set there and can kind of intervene as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting. I want to go back to something you said about the Quick Write, just trying to understand, like how did the Quick Write coincide with the writing that's done on Google Slides, like the thing I'm trying to understand here is like how do we prioritize where writing gets done. Have we stopped using Quick Write in recent times? Because I'm assuming all the usage that you just walked through on NoRedInk, this was all remote, right? This is not in classroom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "It's done in mix. So like what happened in remotely, I guess, is either way, when I had my kids in person, I did the mini lessons. I taught it. So let's say, I pull up examples, I teach them the skill. It's like 5 or 10 minutes, and that is whether you're in front of me in person or whether you're at home, but then I can give the students the practice over the course of the week, so they can sort of work on their own. So one way I'd use it prior to the pandemic was the best way that kids learn writing is writing conferences.\n",
    "And so what I will do is I will have students working on NoRedInk in the classroom while I go around and have writing conferences. So it frees me to like have individual writing conferences because the students are practicing, they're getting immediate feedback from NoRedInk, and I know that they're actually progressing their skills, so that's kind of how I would provide the practice time in an in-person situation.\n",
    "But I guess, yes, with remote learning, it would be like an asynchronous lesson. I would say, like finish with practice, and they would do that when they're remote. But I've used it in both situations or both styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "That's super helpful. Just to clarify, writing conferences like when you and a student are doing one-on-one analysis on their writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So I'm sitting down with a student, I'm saying like we do just a quick structured conference. People do them all different ways, but I basically say, like why did you make this choice? Or like tell me about your writing? It's a way for me to engage with them about sort of to get in their head what they understand and don't understand.\n",
    "And it's where I provide the glow and the growth. So I'll say, I really liked how you used evidence here. For your next steps, I want you to work on this, and the kid will ask any questions, and then they will take their writing, revise it, and I'll move on to the next kid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "And are you doing that via NoRedInk? Or is that you've printed out their paper and you're marking it up with a red pen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean, I typically do them, the writing is all online. I don't really do the paper thingy very much, so it'll be like Google comments. If they've written the writing response in Google Docs or in Google Slides, so I'll put the glow and the grow there. Google Classroom has a rubric tool that you can grade with. So I'll provide that. But basically, it's a way for me to give verbal feedback.\n",
    "I have not done writing conferences with NoRedInk, but mainly because I use them primarily for like practicing skills and assessing their skills, and to kind of get back to your original question, the Quick Write versus what's done in Google Classroom, basically, any sort of assignment, so we'll read a document, and I'll ask them to write an argumentive paragraph, if that's the case.\n",
    "So we're reading To Kill a Mockingbird right now and I want you to write an argument about whether or not this person's act was justified. They will write that in Google Docs or in Google Slides. And then I will take that response. I will grade it with the rubric and find overarching skill gaps. I'll immediately create a unit on NoRedInk where they are practicing.\n",
    "So one component of NoRedInk, especially on the grammar side, is the practice where they, I'll say, practice, joining sentences, using coordinating conjunctions and commas. So it gets increasingly harder. There are 4 or 5 different little threads or strands of skills that they'll work on.\n",
    "And then on Friday, they'll take a quiz, and then I'll have them look back at their writing in Google Docs. And not only will they have the feedback that I've given them on structure, right, like use stronger evidence or use this. But they will also then, I will say, please also correct any fragments that you have based on what we practiced in NoRedInk.\n",
    "So they're able to sort of apply both skills to the writing. And one of them is something that they've learned on NoRedInk. And through my mini lesson and the other is something they've learned through the writing conference. So that by the time that they revise their essay, they fix sort of the convention side and the structure side, and their writing is better. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So the writing in Google Docs, you sign once you see issues, you're creating a tailored unit in NoRedInk. You gave an example, they practice throughout the week, on Friday, you give the quiz on NoRedInk. Is that the right way to think about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. And then once you give out the quiz, you grade it, assuming they've done well or they have a better understanding of it than before, you say, hey, go back to the Google Doc or the Google Slide where you wrote this argumentive paragraph or whatever the tailored concept was and apply what you learned tactically from NoRedInk back into that. And that's happening all in Google Docs, Google Slides.\n",
    "Is there an integration between NoRedInk and Google Docs and Slides? Like I'm just trying to understand how we maintain continuity or how you kind of drive home what the kids have learned on NoRedInk to make sure that it gets reflected in the Google Docs and Slides? Like how are you driving alignment there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So the practice component and the quiz component, all of that is done on NoRedInk. So that's posted on Google Classroom, so they see NoRedInk and as part of their Google Classroom, the way that Google Classroom is set up, I'm sure you're aware, but like there's different assignments. And so essentially, they'll see assignment number 1 is practice, assignment number 2 is their writing piece, assignment number 3 is their quiz and then assignment number 4 is their revisions.\n",
    "And so that's sort of like in the kid's mind, I know I'm going to do a Classroom. Sometimes it's a link to NoRedInk. And I just do the NoRedInk or sometimes it's a link to my document that I'm working on. So there's no direct integration. So again, I'm using the free version. So I'm not sure what they've built recently, if there is an easier way to tie it all together.\n",
    "But for me, it's more of, on that Friday, when they take the quiz on NoRedInk, NoRedInk displays it really, really easily for me to see, okay, who really did master that skill and who can I actually hold accountable for making those changes in their own writing. So if you make a 75 or above, I can basically now hold you accountable in the paragraph that you just wrote for finding those skills.\n",
    "And then for those kids who didn't do so well, I do a remediation. So I'll do another mini lesson with just those smaller group of kids, I'll often check, and it's a direct link between the students who didn't finish their practice. Because it's mastery based, it teaches them very well. There's almost always a direct connection between students who've completed their practice and their final assessment grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So practice via NoRedInk, writing assignment, maybe let me ask a weird question here. The practice via NoRedInk is being prompted by a writing assignment going to write, right? Like is that the right way to think about it? Or is it, hey, we're learning this concept and to master that concept, I'm going to give you a writing assignment through which inherently you have to prove to me that you get the concept you just learned on NoRedInk?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I would say it leans more heavily. And I have chosen these sub skills that I know I want the students to have because obviously, when you're based off standards, like some of the standards in seventh grade are what dictate what goes into my diagnostic. But in reality, the students are just very far behind in grammar.\n",
    "So I'll use the diagnosis and then I would just plan out for unit one like here are the 5 skills we're going to practice on NoRedInk. And then as students start to produce more writing, it becomes more of a reactive. So I'll say, well, like there is a lot of struggle with homophone. And then like I'll make sure that they go in and they practice like there and there or 2 and 2.\n",
    "And so I can just either assign sort of a big picture skill, like commas, which have 15 different things that they need to know, commas and list, commas and joining coordinating conjunctions, like I can either sign a big picture thing or I can say, wow, every single kid used to with the wrong way. Here's the mini lesson, and I'll assign it to them, and then I'll have them go through either their own writing or their peers writing and apply it.\n",
    "So it comes from both angles sort of me laying out a plan for the year and then me responding to their writing as well, which is I actually think is the benefit. Like I think there are curriculums that, for example, i-Ready, it says here is the seventh grade skills. And so when I am a seventh grade student, it automatically will personalize and assign me content. But the reality for teachers is, one, students often come missing a huge swath of skills.\n",
    "And so for me to just assign seventh grade stills, especially in grammar, where you can't really do anything if you don't know what a subject or verb, and now the parts of speech, it is a waste of my time to just assign you seventh grade skill. So NoRedInk recommends the skills. So it's like here's what's typically done in seventh grade, but I almost always have to go 3, 4 years back. So that's one of the reasons.\n",
    "And also, most ELA teachers that I've ever worked with and that I know, and that I worked with both in edtech and personally are, they have units designed around novels that they kind of build out. So I am actually pulling in different tools and different pieces to fulfill a very specific need within my novel unit.\n",
    "So I don't need an all-encompassing like a plug-and-play type experience for students. I am often pulling in texts that are relevant. So for our current unit, for example, To Kill a Mockingbird, my prompts change as the times change. So obviously, there's Derek Chauvin's trial right now, and To Kill a Mockingbird is about a trial.\n",
    "So that I pulled those texts in. And with NoRedInk, I can sort of apply, I can keep the skills and just apply the skills as needed. And it fits really nicely within my unit, even if it's not something we're spending 2 periods of class per week on, it's something that I can pull in and use as both proactive and responsive, which is just something that I struggled with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I just want to ask you a direct question, like does NoRedInk have tailored content? So is there To Kill a Mockingbird-focused content? Or is that something that you're customizing yourself?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "They've been adding more writing stuff. So honestly, I'm trying to get my school to buy it for us next year because I think it's the best writing program out there. And so one thing I'm really excited about is that most of their writing content is a little bit behind the paywall. So that's why I haven't used much of their writing stuff.\n",
    "My eighth grade teacher was really excited to see that they were like claims and evidence and as someone who has seen that content because I worked there, like that is what I will definitely be incorporating more NoRedInk next year when I'm teaching arguments if we can have the premium. So I'm working on the free side of things, mainly, which is sort of but limits.\n",
    "They do have content on like, they've been incorporating more sort of reading response writing. I've seen some examples of like Trevor Noah, they read an article and then they respond to it. Like that is the stuff I would really like to be assigning to my students. But for the most part, I'm also finding that content, like teachers really care about customization, right?\n",
    "And the reason why a lot of these programs will fail is because you have a teacher, like this eighth great teacher that I work with, who is very much like taught the same unit many years over and over and over. And what's nice about NoRedInk is you can say, well, you're just replacing this one little component, you used to give out worksheets on this skill or you used to like keep this one way. You can use NoRedInk in that exact same way, it's just done online, it's auto graded and mastery based, so it's much more effective.\n",
    "So teachers can wrap their minds around that versus like you have To Kill a Mockingbird unit on NoRedInk when you're like, well, I already have a To Kill a Mockingbird unit that I wrote myself. So I'm less likely to use all of those pieces.\n",
    "So I think NoRedInk is really great. The more of their like unit specific content is sort of like shorter reading piece and then a written response, which is probably the extent which I would ever use premade content on a like technology program, like much more, then that is like too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Forget writing for a second. Just on the grammar side. When you're like teaching grammar concepts, is there tailored content for the grammar? So like say I’m in class, so like I hate reading about Shakespeare and Oliver Twist but if that same story is about Manny from Modern Family, it's pretty interesting to me, whatever your favorite TV show or book is. Like do you have that functionality in NoRedInk where even the grammar content is being tailored to the students' liking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So I guess sort of foundationally, something I didn't reference. The kids really love NoRedInk because the first thing you do is you pick all your favorite books and movies, and then every sentence that you get assigned has your favorite books and movies, those characters are in the sentences. So the sentences are hilarious.\n",
    "So I have kids who like screen-shot it, and they will send it me and they'll be like, oh, my gosh, it says that Harry Potter like how's the sales done. So it's very engaging and it sort of pulls the students in on their own, and it's almost gamified in that they really hate to get one wrong, then they have to like remediate. So in that respect, it is personalized.\n",
    "It is sort of like tailored to the students' interest and every kid practices the same skill, but we'll see a completely different sentence because they plug-in whatever, some have Taylor Swift, some have like, I don't know, Hannah Montana, literally 2 characters that nobody else in my class would select. But that's like the engagement piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Like there's two parts of it, right? One is like the student part, and it seems like there's engagement there. Like, as you said, Harry Potter, that's pretty engaging. The thing that I think a lot about is what you just said, right, what I'm trying to get at is you love NoRedInk. It's clear to me. You use it, maybe you're biased, but aren't we all, in some way, shape or form.\n",
    "What I don't understand is why doesn't every other teacher or most other teachers see what you're seeing? Is it because it's not aligned with the curriculum such that, hey, in seventh and eighth grade English, we read these 10 books, right? And NoRedInk for better or for worse, I'm just making this up, only aligns with 3 out of the 12 books.\n",
    "So while NoRedInk is a good supplemental grammar evaluation tool, it can never become a core part of my workflow or curriculum because they just don't have the penetration on my curriculum, like is that the case? Like I'm just trying to understand like why are you the only teacher using it the way you are, whether it's proactively with that use case or reactively and your other peer teachers are not? Like is it they don't like tech? Is it there's a curriculum gap with NoRedInk? Like what's the reason?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that's a really great question. So I have a couple of different reasons that I think are tied to me specifically and my school specifically, but then just more broadly, first of all, there is a school of thought I'm sure you're aware, but this education is very cyclical. It will say we only want to teach deeper learning.\n",
    "So like you should only be asking higher order thinking questions and get away from like practice and just sort of like rote memorization. And then the pendulum will swing all the way back and be like, well, we have a whole group of kids who can answer a deep question, but when they try to formulate their writing, they don't know how to put it into a sentence.\n",
    "So there's like a big pendulum swinging. So I think a big blocker for some teachers with NoRedInk is that some of them do not prioritize grammar. And that often is dictated by either the teachers preference by the state. So some states on their final state assessment really push grammar and some states don't. So like Virginia, Texas, they push grammar, and New York doesn't as much.\n",
    "So like I graded the New York State assessment for like a full week. And basically, if you could kind of decipher what the kid was saying, you could give them credit. And for me, that is not sufficient because I know the second they did in the high school and/or college. The reason many of our kids fell out of English is because of they can't write a sentence with like the proper punctuation or grammar, like it's just imperfect.\n",
    "So I teach it because I've also taught high school, and I know what's coming. Some teachers skip it because they just sort of listen to whatever is on the state test. So there's sort of that struggle there.\n",
    "Now the specialized high school test in New York City does test grammar. So the teachers in eighth grade are aware that their kids need to be prepared for that specialized high school test if they want to get into Bronx Science or Stuyvesant. And so some of them will provide the grammar teaching. So then that's one of the things. So just like does the state really care about grammar.\n",
    "But because NoRedInk is investing heavily in writing and specifically things like argumentative writing and they're incorporating practice on claims, on evidence. Argumentation is like the piece of writing that all districts want their kids to master, right? That is what the all-state test assess. They care about your ability to craft a compelling argument, and NoRedInk has really blown out that piece.\n",
    "They've like created a lot of learning, and that's the stuff that drives me nuts that I can't access right now because I would actually be using NoRedInk probably 1.5 to 2x as frequently if I could access their content and they've got stuff like citations, embedding quotations, like that's the stuff that I'm creating manual lessons about.\n",
    "And then I have to go back and then grade and really struggle, that's very time-consuming to be like, hey, move the period here, put the parenthesis, but also like how do you paraphrase, like those are skills that teachers really love. So I think by building out their writing component and specifically their argumentation, that makes a huge difference on how many teachers will use it.\n",
    "And I don't think when you said something like curriculum changing my books, two of them use NoRedInk. I think it's better to think about it in terms of standards and not curriculum. So curriculum is the way you keep the standards. So no matter what book I teach in seventh grade, I have to make sure that my students understand what theme and central idea are, what's the difference between the 2.\n",
    "And then like in eighth grade, they build on that and say, well, then you need to say how the plot affects the same. So standards are what you should really kind of keep your eye on and whether the state standards directly reference things like grammar.\n",
    "And New York uses Common Core and Common Core does actually talk about those, does require them to learn things each year in grammar. But because the state test doesn't emphasize it as much, they're less frequently taught. But I know in like Virginia, they push it pretty heavily, like some of our biggest groups of people who use NoRedInk were in these states that were testing the grammar piece as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think there are more states that care about grammar in our country than don't? Or do you think it's vice versa?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess, between the number of states that care and that assess, it's more about assessing it. So it's like whether the state cares or not doesn't really matter if it's on a state that holds teachers that are held accountable to. That's what matters.\n",
    "I would say a lot of states abandoned it and are bringing it back. This conference was very much big picture versus like nitty gritty, I would say the majority of English teachers care about grammar.\n",
    "They just are struggling with like how do I teach it, where do I fit it in? Like how can I fit this into what I'm teaching, which is why I think NoRedInk is powerful because my students has, every unit has vocabulary, it has grammar and then it has the reading, writing component. So no matter what novel I'm teaching, I can assign NoRedInk because it is skill-based.\n",
    "So I can try this unit, we're focusing on commas for clarity. And it doesn't matter if you're reading To Kill a Mockingbird or The Long Lost Letter or any other book, it's there and it's available. So I think the reason teachers aren't using it primarily is because of awareness.\n",
    "And I think right now, I've had a few, like the eighth grade teacher was like that was really cool. I can't handle anything new right now because she is full time remote teaching and she is just completely overwhelmed versus my Department Chair who was like, oh my gosh, I'm using this.\n",
    "She literally, when I showed it to her, she immediately created a lesson that kids started the next day because she was able to replace something that she was already using, whether it looks like a grammar worksheet or she was sick of saying, this is a fragment, and the kid is saying, what's a fragment. So now the kids do practice and identify it.\n",
    "So I think NoRedInk will always be, within ELA curriculums and tools, I don't know how close NoRedInk can be a poor product or poor curriculum, but I think it is one of the most powerful supplemental tools. And do you know the difference between like core and supplemental curriculum?\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",

    "No. Can you substantiate that? That would be super helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Core curriculum is going to be your main tool that teaches your main thing that's provided to you. So previously, think of your like textbooks back in the old school days, your textbook was like core curriculum and then supplemental curriculum is anything that you bring in to kind of supplement that core curriculum. So things like grammar tools or things that are maybe like Quizlet or vocabulary, like bringing in things like vocabulary tools.\n",
    "And the majority of ELA, especially secondary ELA teachers, they don't really use core curriculum materials as much because they build their curriculum around novels. So they'll select whatever novels they want to teach and then they'll find, okay, I'm going to use this sort of this grammar, I'm going to use this sort of vocabulary and that sort of thing.\n",
    "So I'm seeing a shift in districts. They used to be like, okay, we're going to buy, I don't know, HMH, a big HMH contract and that will be our curriculum that we provide. Many schools are stricter like, there are many teachers are pushing back, many schools are pushing back and saying, we don't want that. We're not going to use that.\n",
    "I've never once in my teaching career used that textbook. What I need are tools like NoRedInk that I can use every single week. And I need these different things to kind of supplement what I'm already building. And so that's what I think NoRedInk, it could be seen as a weakness, or I think it provides saying power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any digital core tools? Maybe that's the question I want to get at. Like the core versus supplemental, are there any core tools that are software plays? Like is Nearpod or Newsela, like are all those supplemental? Is the right way to think about it, all edtech SaaS tools, they're all supplemental and none are core? Or are there core tools? Maybe I'm just not figuring it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there are core tools. I mean, like HMH, I think, has converted a lot of their resources to digital. But like Nearpod is more of an infrastructure piece, right? I use Nearpod with my students. And the way that I use Nearpod is, it's basically like an engaging PowerPoint, right? I can move the students through a PowerPoint and then insert polls or quick writes or like quiz questions in the middle of a lesson to make sure my students are with me.\n",
    "So you can use that, like the science team uses that, I use that, like that is sort of an infrastructure piece, similar to Quizlet, right. Quizlet is a tool where you can just make essentially no cards, and it can be any sort of content piece. Whereas like Newsela is writing and reading or I guess, I don't know if it's writing, actually.\n",
    "I've only ever used it for reading, and Newsela is like a really, really powerful tool. But I don't know of any school district that uses it as this is only reading material. And ELA, like I said, it's mainly novel-based. So I think of the curriculum that I used in my other school in New York City was Engage New York, which is like an expeditionary learning curriculum.\n",
    "And that provided me with novels to teach and then lessons to teach alongside it. But those same things, like those curriculums, had a Grammar component. So what I would do is I could just essentially convert what is some worksheets they provided around commas, I can just say all is same on NoRedInk.\n",
    "So that's why I think it's a powerful tool because it can kind of plug-in whether it's a really structured kind of scripted curriculum like Engage New York is or you're like me, my current principle doesn't care what I teach. It's like you pick the novel, and I'm building an entire unit based on what I want to teach. It is just standard the line, which is all that she cares about. And so I can easily set in NoRedInk into that as well.\n",
    "But I do think supplemental tools are the tools that teachers love the most. I think some of your older teachers who maybe are sort of like not super into inventing and building, they are more likely to rely on a curriculum. So that is like a bigger core curriculum tool than most of your teachers who are like actively planning and working with students. They are going to build out their units and use primarily supplemental tools to get that lesson across.\n",

    "Interesting. Maybe a couple of tactical questions. Like in my head, there's a spectrum in my head. On one end of the spectrum is nice to have, on the other end is mission-critical. Is NoRedInk nice to have? Is it mission-critical? Or is it somewhere in between, meaning one way or another?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "So I would say premium and this is a challenge for NoRedInk because I know about the premium content and what's in that pay wall. I would say if we had premium, that would be much closer to the mission-critical, like I think NoRedInk for me is a must-have in my classroom, no matter what, but the premium would move it further over to mission-critical than nice to have.\n",
    "I would say right now because I just have access to a limited number of topics and a limited number of tools, I would say it's kind of squarely between the 2. But when you add in that argumentation stuff, which is what every single state assesses and what every teacher teaches, I think that moves into the right space. So it's like mission-critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting. And I guess the other question I have is like so we just talked about this. You've been teaching at your current school since September. So it's your first calendar year, I guess, yes, first actual year of teaching. When is the soonest you can get the school to get NoRedInk? Would it be the next school year, so like this summer, the end of this summer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, specifically, the contracts would kick off and you can buy it whenever, but the contracts are typically yearly. They e-mailed all their teachers who are using it. So I think this is totally okay to share. But they're basically like if you buy now, you get the rest of the year for free.\n",
    "I think it's more along the lines of like when your schools budgeting is happening, is when the money is free. And so I haven't yet heard from my AP. Honestly, my school is a bit of a mess. So they're just like kind of sloppy, but I do know that like right now, it's kind of prime buying. And I know that a lot of times, when I worked at schools at NoRedInk, they would want access.\n",
    "Like so we have it sooner than later? Like they wanted it as soon as they bought it because typically, what I love about NoRedInk is it really is incredible the reach that it's gotten already. Like they haven't done tone of marketing, like there are tons of tools out there that I have seen like flamed in my face as a teacher repeatedly.\n",
    "That's kind of where we were with marketing, but it is spread like wildfire because teachers love it so much. And I follow a lot of these like teacher blogs and Instagram teachers and all of that and I'm on almost every secondary ELA website or blog when they say their list of must-haves for a teacher, NoRedInk is on it.\n",
    "So I think there's a really passionate group of users who want it and who will like keep using it. And then I think it's a matter of just making sure that more and more people hear about it and seeing it spread in that way. Because I think there is the older version of it was very much grammar-only. And so some teachers maybe have looked at it once or twice but haven't gone back.\n",
    "But now that there's argumentation piece, I think if more teachers saw that, they'd be like, wow, there's like an attractive component here. Like practice is critical for students to learn. And it's so hard to practice writing without a huge amount of time input by a teacher for grading. If do one minute on every paragraph, that's 1.5 hours, then I only get 45 minutes of planning a day.\n",
    "So if I can give kids an assignment on practicing claims, and they are automatically getting feedback, I can see how they're progressing through it. I can see their common errors. I can use that data to then invest my time and like much more tailored small group work, that's all the money in the world. So I think that's kind of where it's at.\n",

    "I would say 10 out of 10. The thing I've told everybody, I like Newsela a lot. I've used Newsela. I'd probably use Newsela 3 or 4 times this year. I've used NoRedInk, I don't even know how many times. Like I mean NoRedInk comes up in parent, teacher conferences like, parents are like, they love that. They think it's so funny.

    "\n",
    "So I've moved to biweekly, but in a normal school year, my curriculum, I've had to basically chop in half because of the pandemic. So now I do 4 novels and then every week, we have a grammar, vocabulary, and then we have our lessons. So on Tuesday, we do vocab, on Weds/Thursday, we do grammar or whatever. But I've had to move to biweekly, but the kids are working on it probably 2 to 3 times.\n",
    "So like I said, the structure was just sort of like a mini lesson, 4 days to complete the practice and then a quiz. So I'm using it at least twice during class, and then kids that were using it maybe once or twice in addition to that. Normal year, weekly; this year, biweekly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting. And so using it biweekly during normal times and that weekly during normal times, that was in class and outside of class or only outside of class or only in class, pre-COVID?\n",

    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",

    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I would do like a mini lesson 10, 15 minutes. And then I'd get them started on their practice. So I'd say you have 10 minutes to work on your practice. I would walk around, see where they were struggling, do some quick reteach. And then the rest of practice was homework. And then they come into class, they'd log into NoRedInk on Fridays and their quiz is right there.\n",
    "Because NoRedInk, it's so easy, like you take your topic, and then you can either assign practice or quiz or growth quiz. And so it's so easy for me to just do like, here's the 4 topics for practice. And then I click 1 button, it says, make a quiz, and then like I make the quiz, and I set it all up at the beginning of the week and the quiz goes live on Friday.\n",
    "So like it's just very much structured in a way that I don't have to really think about it, and my mini lessons don't really change. I do pull up NoRedInk on the screen, and we practice a few together. Yes, I would say the homework piece is where they do, I would say, probably at least half of their practice. For the rest, it's in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "And so just to clarify, that 15 minute mini lesson, is that coming from NoRedInk? Are you teaching via NoRedInk? Or is it more of like I have my own stuff and NoRedInk is just where people do the practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "So the best kind of practice for students is like mimicking the setting that they'll be practicing in. So I always practice a few questions on the big screen of NoRedInk. At first, I use my own grammar lessons and then use NoRedInk to practice, but because NoRedInk is so good, they have these lessons at the beginning, some of them are guided, and then some of them are just sort of like static PDF.\n",
    "I actually have now aligned all of my teaching. My grammar curriculum is now aligned with the same way that they refer to things. So they call it like FANBOYS is what they use to refer to coordinating conjunctions, For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, and So. So I actually went from going just coordinating conjunctions to now I use FANBOYS too to align them so that the kids see the same thing. So I'll create my own lessons based off of the curriculum, but I always have NoRedInk up.\n",

    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So because it's mastery- based and provides immediate feedback, I am more comfortable with students doing this outside of class because if they get something wrong, they are corrected. So more of it has been done independently during a remote time than I would normally do in non-COVID times. So I would say it's probably like the opposite, it's probably 40%, they do their quiz in class with me.\n",
    "We solve the mini lesson, but the majority of the practice is done, I'll have them sign off of Zoom and work on their practice because I can also track how far they've gotten. So on Wednesday, I'll be like, okay, this group, please stay on. I see you're below 50% down with your practice, it's due tomorrow, what's your status.

    "I guess, maybe let me ask the direct question. What's changed in in-class versus out of class usage, apart from the obvious fact that schools were shut for quite a while? Like has our usage or your perception of NoRedInk changed because of COVID?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "I think I have more of an affinity for it because of COVID because what I worry about is, so for example, my kids who are blended. So they come in once or 3 times a week. I feel okay giving them NoRedInk to work on at home without me because it does the work of providing immediate feedback. It does the work of like tailoring, it's engaging, they know how to do it. Like it is something that I feel really grateful that I can use for asynchronous lessons.\n",
    "And so I think that piece, I've been more comfortable assigning it for them to do independently than I was pre-COVID. I would try to give them more time in class. So we're kind of pre-COVID. But I think going back, I'll probably still do about 60-40 in class and out of class, but I may be more willing to provide the students more of their practice at home.\n",
    "Because right now, I only give them 45 minutes' worth of work each day whereas previously, we'd have class for 45 minutes and then I would try to provide 15 to 20 minutes of a homework assignment. So there was more class time in total. So my curriculum is halved right now because I do not provide additional work outside of what would be the normal school day because kids' mental health is important right now and the kids are just not getting the stuff done.\n",
    "So I have less time overall to teach. And I have even less time than ever with them actually with me. The NoRedInk is a powerful way for me to still keep them learning without me sitting beside them and then doing something wrong over and over again, which is like what happens with their grammar worksheet.\n",

    "It helps scale you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly. That's the business term that I will drop when I'm in the LA meetings, I'm like, this is scalable, and they're like, what's scale? And then I realize I've to figure out my head side talk. It's scale. And that's, I think, for riding instruction and teachers writing, honestly, grading is the reason I had burn out when I left the classroom 5 years ago because grading writing is so impossible.\n",
    "And NoRedInk fills like a very critical role in that because it is feedback that is provided immediately to the student and it is not something that I have to be present to give that feedback for, which is why I really want the premium because I still have to manually do feedback on things like claims and evidence.\n",
    "And if I could assign that too in NoRedInk, I mean I think that scales my impact, right, and argumentation, which is something we spend our entire year working on, that like doubles my ability to help students. And then I can really provide them critical feedback in their writing and see that writing grow. Because when students practice something, they get better, but the limiting factor is how much can I grade of their practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. You're the bottleneck. How quickly can you give them feedback, practice adaptively and get better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly. And NoRedInk teaches them. I think there are other websites that sort of like auto grade, right, it will say like, oh, that's a fragment. But if you don't know what a fragment is and you get feedback that you wrote fragment, your feedback is pointless, right?\n",
    "And so before NoRedInk, I had to like, I could only provide feedback on so many things. But now I can say, okay, you need to fix this. This is a fragment. Here's an assignment on the NoRedInk going to the practice and then come back to this writing assignment and make the adjustments.\n",
    "And so that feedback loop is so much quicker, and we can cover so much more ground because I have a tool that allows them to practice, learn the basic skills, learn why a comma is needed there. And then go back to their writing, which is really what you need with teaching, writing and structured teaching writing conventions and all that sort of thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I mean, as you kind of alluded to, I wish we had this stuff when we were coming up. I have a lot of PTSD from seeing my teacher having to grade a lot of papers, but more importantly, learning it in an analog context as opposed to a digital one that is adaptive and reactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle School English/Language Arts Teacher at NYC Department of Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I mean, I literally do the same practices before I teach them, just to remind myself of these things, like you can go and do that. And I have kids who are obsessed with NoRedInk and will like on their free time just go and practice other skills because the kids can kind of have access to whatever they want. So I have really enjoyed relearning it too, because I had those grammar worksheets in my day, it's kind of rough, though. It's a different world for those kids.\n",
    "\n",

    "'''Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello. Well, thanks for taking the time. The context behind this call is that we're spending a little bit of time with sort of ways you can pay contractors as well as international employees. And one of the ways that came up was Deel and I saw that you were a customer of Deel.\n",
    "So we're spending a little bit of time in this space trying to better understand how it works and the value proposition that Deel or Remote and all these guys provide to people like yourselves. And so maybe the best place to start would just be to hear a little bit more about the company you're at as well as your role and how you guys use Deel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. And I've actually been doing like this exact call with -- I think I've done it like 6 or 7 times now. So I think I'm pretty well-versed on this. So yes, I think this may be a popular space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "I know like you've probably been doing this for the last 6 months, like just on and off, but curious how recent that was.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Pretty much since the nationwide quarantine started. I think there were a lot during then. And I obviously can't complain. But I think, recently, it slowed down. I think Deel -- after Deel it was like, I think, Series B, it slowed down on that side. Because I think our logo is listed on their site, so I'm sure that's why they hooked up to me.\n",
    "But yes, so I'm the founder of 2 companies, both of which use Deel. And one is called Italic. You can kind of think of it as like a Costco for premium goods online. So we have membership, and we design and develop a lot of different products. And we have over 1,000 SKUs, and we have a small team in China and the Philippines, some of whom we use Deel to pay.\n",
    "And then the second company is called Not Pot. It's a fun, kind of like American mom's brand. That one's bootstrapped. It's been around for around almost 5 years now. And we use Deel for our contractor workforce for that as well. And actually, as of COVID, we started using it for a couple of full-time hires as well.\n",
    "So yes, very well-versed on Deel. Early on, I think around 2.5 years ago, we also looked at Papaya. And Remote at the time was, I think, was just -- I think it was still under beta for their PEO service. Maybe it was about -- I think Remote was in beta about a year ago when we looked at it for full-time hires remotely. But yes, that's my, I think, exposure in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Super helpful. So I guess it would be helpful to understand like how you guys were doing it before Deel, if you guys were still working with international contractors back then, and then kind of like how you heard about Deel and how it works now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So what we were using before Deel was kind of a combination of different systems. So for our domestic contractor payroll, we would use the combination of Gusto, where they would invoice us directly and our accounting resource would kind of pay those out one by one. And then we collect 1099 at the end of the tax year.\n",
    "So it's kind of spread out domestically. But then internationally, it's really complicated. So in Eastern Europe, we used Payoneer and transfer -- sorry, Eastern Europe, we use Payoneer most commonly. Western Europe, more commonly will be PayPal or TransferWise. In Asia, and pretty much every country except for China would be PayPal.\n",
    "And then China is where it gets very complicated. We use the combination of Veem, which I believe just lost their individual, like consumer license, for payments; and Airwallex, which had the best rates. But then we went through the entire -- I mean, we literally spent 6, 7 months and a lot of money kind of setting up a China entity.\n",
    "So the way Italic works is we have the Delaware C-Corp on top and then a Hong Kong shell underneath, which then wholly owns it in China. And that's how we actually hired and employed our team in China. Had Deel existed, I don't know if we would have gone that route. China employment is very different than, I think, a lot of other countries. So it's one where, I think, like that was one of the really, I think, big appeals about Deel is the ability to do payroll locally.\n",
    "Since one of the founders is actually, I think, like from Shanghai, so that was important to them. But yes, so that's what we were using previously. I think I heard about Deel -- so I didn't flex like Y Combinator back in 2015. I was actually helping the founder of Deel, which has kind of -- they pivoted like, I think, 4 or 5 times before they arrived on Deel. But I missed investing because I think I was -- at that point, I would say like, \"Yes, they've pivoted so many times, it's like there's no way this is going anywhere.\"\n",
    "But that's how I first heard about it. It was like, \"Hey, I'm building this thing now, like would you mind checking it out?\" And I think that's how he got a lot of his first customers early on, 2 years ago, was through the Y Combinator network of just alumni. A lot of start-ups, I think, started. I think Remote was kind of taboo pre -- like in maybe 4 or 5 years ago, and then the past 2 to 3 years, it's, I think, become a lot more accepted and commonplace as I'm sure everyone is aware.\n",
    "But I think back then, I think the options for remote payroll, you could do it through -- I mean, there's so many solutions but you could do it through PayPal, which you have to do very manually. You could do it through like things like Upwork, by bringing your own contract. But the administration wasn't great and the payment rails that they offered to the contractors weren't great. You could do it kind of self-serve and do wires, which cost money.\n",
    "So I think when he came up with Deel, it was like, \"Oh, actually, yes, I'll try it out.\" It was super buggy back then, and I think they've screwed up payments for us a couple of times. But it's improved like tremendously over the years. And I think, now, like domestic or international, we actually have on Deel. And it's not even for remote contractors now. We actually have like in-person contractors also on Deel.\n",
    "Just because it's so much easier to use than Justworks or Gusto or Rippling in terms of like adding a contractor and administering that. And the contractor experience is pretty nice, too. So yes, we stuck around, and I think they had scaled really nicely, so -- yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "That's awesome. What do you guys use for your payroll? Do you guys use Gusto or Rippling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we use Gusto. We actually looked at Rippling, who also does international, I think, contracted payroll. But yes, I think like, at the time, Gusto was kind of the de facto that are going to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting. Does Gusto offer a way to do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Gusto does for domestic contractors. And for what it's worth, they've improved that product significantly. When we were using it, it's so painful to use the contractor product. And it's also only U.S. And it's, think in Q4, they improved it quite a bit. So it's not like as painful as it once was, but no. So for us, like we wouldn't be able to use Gusto. And also, we wanted like a centralized place to put all of our kind of freelancers and contractors. So we moved all of our contractors actually out of Gusto into Deel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Interesting. Did you guys look at Rippling as well? Or were you already on Gusto by the time Rippling became relatively well-known?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we did. And Rippling actually had, from day 1, like an ability to do international contractor payroll. I spoke to a CTO and he was like, \"Yes, we basically like white-labeled like an SVB product.\" And I think like the main reason why we didn't use Rippling at the time, in full transparency, it was like we used benefits from my first company. And now, it was really like those -- administration-wise, there are like months where I think we missed like insurance or something.\n",
    "So I think I was very scarred by that. So we went with Gusto. But I think if we were to kind of choose today, Rippling is really compelling. It's like much more fully featured, I think, in terms of the suite than Gusto out of the box. But I don't know, like I think, for us, it's okay right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Yes. And I'd imagine like once you got fully integrated into a Gusto, it's probably too much of a hassle to like try and move obviously for -- yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I -- actually, that's a very good point. So I moved March, and I had to like set up employment and all that stuff for registration for the company where I moved to. And I was actually looking into, \"Okay, can we migrate like out of Gusto into like a PEO, like Justworks and/or like TriNet?\" And yes, the switching cost was super high because it's like all of your insurance is baked into there, all like the payroll data. You don't know what's going to happen if you switch. So yes, it's sticky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Totally. No, that makes sense. We had heard actually that Rippling was planning on like more or less partnering with Deel and kind of basically offering the Deel product to Rippling. I don't know if you heard that, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, wow, no. I mean that makes sense, though. That makes a lot of sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I guess it makes sense like if you can't -- or like if you don't have the resources or like bandwidth to build the best-in-class like Deel-like product in-house, you just work with Deel and maybe get like cut-off commissions or something like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Yes. I think a similar setup was like Brex and TravelBank, in which like they didn't have the time to build out the points, or flights reservations or anything, so they just white-labeled TravelBank. And they're still like partnered really deeply. So that would be pretty cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Got it. And did you guys do like a full RFP when you decided to use Deel? Or you talked to the founders and you were like, \"Oh, this is the perfect product for us. We'll just use it.\" Or did you like actually go through a process and like actually test out Remote and Papaya and other products?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. We looked at 5 different solutions because it was an important decision. And at the time, I was skeptical of Deel because it was like kind of buggy. And I think what happened with Deel is like Deel was really focused on SMB and start-up. And that's where we were. They made self-serve onboarding super easy. It was very basic at the time, and it still is like missing, I think, a lot of functionality. So that was Deel.\n",
    "And then we had a trial at Papaya. I think, at the time, it was like crossing the chasm river. Like I think they had a start-up, they had like enterprise. And I think like once you logged into the trial product, it was very clear that it was like enterprise-focused, that it's -- even though it's like set, one contract dropped. There's like departments and teams, like templates, et cetera, all of which is important. But I think the start-up is like, \"Let's just get going.\" So Papaya, we had a trial. Remote, we spoke briefly, but I think like didn't have the contractor product. And I believe they still don't, so that kind of ruled that out for us.\n",
    "We looked at Upwork. But I think for both the contractor experience in terms of like submitting hours as well as the payout options to contractors, I think they actually weren't -- like Deel was stronger from day one than Upwork on that.\n",
    "And then there was one other option called Pilot, pilot.co, I believe, which was kind of like -- it's kind of more like Upwork because it's we either find you a full-time and we administer payroll for you. That's like a PEO service. Or you can bring your own employees internationally like a number. And there, I think they're more focused on like South America and Eastern Europe, I believe, than Southeast Asia.\n",
    "So those are the ones we looked at. And I think like we kind of went back to Deel, and it was like, \"Hey, this is the -- like we're already set up here.\" It's clearly the most like usable even though it's buggy and very, very simple to just set up, and the contractor experience is very nice, so that's why we went with Deel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. And what was your impression of Remote?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, I mean, the team was like obviously very, I think, like very tech-savvy and smart. I think it's very focused -- okay. So when it comes to, I think, international PEOs, I think our thought process was at least like, hey, one of the main reasons for international, yes, is to kind of get more talent, but also, it's costly to train.\n",
    "And if you hire these engineers like at $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 or $100,000 or $120,000, like then, yes, the BPO administration service have like a $200 to $1,000 a month, like it's actually fine because you don't have control of the entity, like the client, whatever.\n",
    "I think where it gets complicated is on every other role, except for those expensive ones, where the actual salary you might pay someone is like $12,000 a year or $40,000 a year and which like the cost of administering a full-time employment contract through Remote would actually be sometimes like more than 50% the actual salary itself.\n",
    "So in those cases, like it didn't really make sense to hire them full-time as like full-time employees. And you can kind of get the same level of service, the same level of like talent and work, but on a full-time contract. So that was the main reason.\n",
    "I'm sure not everyone does this. Like tech start-ups who want to hire like mainly engineers and designers or product managers, like, yes, than I think Remote. For us, we were looking at bringing on like international engineers, and that was something that I think was appealing to us.\n",
    "But at the same time, like I think the cost, it was too much to some, like I think, at the time. And now, I think with Deel and Papaya, I think they both had rolled their own PEO services for a number of the countries. So I think there wouldn't be a reason for us to kind of switch. But I think impression-wise, okay, it made a lot of sense if you were a mostly technical team or technical just kind of product to hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. So I guess like not having run a company, working for like a venture capital firm, I guess I don't understand kind of the intricacies of why, for you, at the time, like Deel was so much better than Papaya, at least from a cost perspective. Do you mind just like breaking it down a little bit further down, like as if I were like a 10-year-old or something like that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. No worries. So the difference between Deel and Papaya, in my opinion, it wasn't actually cost. As far as I'm aware, right now, they're actually, I believe, pretty much the same, I think. I think they're the same, or at least very close to the same. So it wasn't like a pricing reason why we went with Deel over Papaya. Granted, I think, like Papaya is like an enterprise, like I think maybe it will introduce like minimum seats or minimum contracts or annual contracts or whatever, which Deel, I think, like doesn't.\n",
    "So the main, I think, difference was in the user interface and experience for both the administrators as well as the contractors. For the administrators, I think, in Deel, you can get set up in like 5 minutes. You sign up, you add your company info, your EIN, whatever, and you're into the dashboard immediately.\n",
    "And you can create a contract, name it whatever, set the pay rate, like it can be fixed, it can be hourly, it can be like whatever you want. And they have a preloaded contract. You can adjust it. And then like within less than 5 minutes, you can have the contract ready for a contractor to sign. And the contractor experience is great. Like you can send them the link or you can send them an e-mail and then you send them the link.\n",
    "And they will sign it and post it on Deel, and then they will be onboarded. And then they can choose -- they will submit their tax documentation. And then they will also submit their preferred payout method. So if you're in Eastern Europe, you can choose Payoneer. If you're in China, you can choose WeChat. Whatever like method you want, you can even choose like wires, and Deel handles the payouts for contractors.\n",
    "So I don't know, for what it's worth, I don't know what the contractor experience looks like for Papaya. It could be the same for all I know. But on the setup -- and this is the case for, at least, last year, I think, or 1.5 years ago, when we were looking at Papaya. Seriously, when you set up, like -- first of all, you know a company's enterprise when it does request a demo, and you tend to set up a trial yourself, right? So we had to go through -- I think, back then, they were a little bit broader. So you could just set up the trial.\n",
    "We logged in to Papaya. I think the first thing that you have to do is like set up a team structure. So what are the departments? What are the teams? Like who are the kind of like administrators of the teams? You can like invite your whole administrative team. And all in all, it's like, it's not like a 5-minute setup. It's like, hey, you've got -- 5 minutes is like obviously exaggerated. But I think like it's like, okay, to get Papaya up and running, you can tell it's for like a larger type of org that's migrating a larger workforce over.\n",
    "So I'd imagine like if you're really a brute force, that you could get it set up and like get it running in a day. But I think if you have like an actual team running it, we're talking like a week or 2, minimum, I think, to get everyone moved over. And then the actual setup of contracts. Last 1.5 years ago, I don't believe they had like prebuilt Papaya contracts. I think there were also issues with, at least, from a usability standpoint, I was like actually inviting the contractors.\n",
    "But those are the main differences. There was just significantly like a more complex experience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I think for a start-up, it's like, okay, let's just go with the fastest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Got it. And then from a cost perspective, it sounds like the biggest difference was just that Papaya didn't support contractors, so you would have to use a PEO to employ people versus paying out contractors. Which would be cheaper?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh sorry, that comment was referring to Remote. Papaya does. Papaya supports both contractors and like PEO administration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Got it. Do you know if Remote supports contractors now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't believe so. I had a friend who started using them, and I'm pretty sure they're still like full-time employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Got it. Interesting. Yes, I guess that's like an important thing for the types of companies that would be using this, just given the cost angle is a big reason for why people go international.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. Yes. It's a big one. I mean they like cost between like $500 to $1,000 a month for Remote. And you can negotiate that down, right? It's not always that much, but like imagine paying $6,000 for something you're paying like $50,000 a year, too. Actually that's not a bad example. That's not terrible. It's more like imagine you're paying like $6,000 on top of someone you're paying like $20,000, too. That's, I think, harder to stomach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "For sure. Interesting. How about, I guess, the people you work with through Upwork, do you just pay them through the Upwork platform, or how does that work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I actually agree. Upwork, I think, has recognized the threat of a lot of these like external payroll administrators. So I think they're trying to like clamp down on that thing. So yes, previously, it was like we would source talent on Upwork. And Upwork makes money by like a commission on the payouts, right? So you pay them and then they take like a fee and then they pay the contractor. That's how we used to do it. So it was like sourcing talent in Upwork.\n",
    "We'd bring them into Slack and invite them to Deel. And then we never actually run in the payroll through like Upwork itself. Because it's a win-win for us and a win-win for every contractor. Because like you basically bypass the middleman, and you can actually pay in lower rates because Upwork's commission fees were so high. So most contractors are pretty happy about that.\n",
    "Now Upwork has this like very strict -- like if you even type the word \"Slack\" into Upwork, like basically a red flag shows up for both the contractor as well as you, saying like, \"Hey, if you pay someone like outside of Upwork, like both of you are kicked off from the platform.\" So I think they're trying to keep payments on the system so that they can obviously recognize their revenue that way.\n",
    "So now, what we do is like we do typically if we're like a contractor, we'll work with them maybe like an hour or 2. Okay, maybe like a week or 2. And then if it goes well, we'll bring them off Upwork, but at least like Upwork gets that revenue recognition that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. So like give them a little bit upfront and then like maybe, if you like them a lot, bring them in-house?\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, exactly. Right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Got it. Interesting. Yes, I guess, like a lot of the slowdown in Upwork as a public company has been just disintermediation of people, like realizing that Upwork fees are really high and there's much cheaper ways to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, exactly. Yes, that's exactly how I would put it. Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting. Got it. And how does pricing work for Deel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So Deel has changed their pricing model a bunch over the years. But right now, it's very simple. I think it's 30-something dollar -- I think they're like always tied in to the customer charges. So like 30-something dollars per active contractor, plus 1% of the payments that are sent. And we negotiate that, to get the percentage below that, but I mean, it's pretty small. So really, it's $30, I think like $37 or $39 a month per contractor. And I believe that's the same with Papaya as well.\n",
    "Oh, and for PEO administration, I think it's like, it depends on the country. It always depends on the country. But generally, we're talking about a couple of hundred bucks, it's basically 1:1 with what Remote offers. And like the way those typically work is like they partner with local back-office providers in that jurisdiction. So like in, I don't know, in Europe, like there is a payroll administrator, and they will white-label that to offer the PEO service. So yes, that's kind of how the pricing works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Makes a ton of sense. Yes, I was going to ask, like is the $37 to $39, is that per month or per year?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that's right. It's per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Okay. Interesting. Do you know if -- like is there like a product on the contractor's own? Like is there an app that they log into and like can see their payouts and things like that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, exactly. It's not in an app, but it's just a website. And they can log in to the portal and check their payouts. They can submit hours that way. So if you're on a pay-as-you-go contractor, that's what we call them, they can submit hours through the portal, they can change the payout, they can chat with support. So yes, there is.\n",
    "And I think now, actually, Deel is offering more, I think, contractor services. So they just announced like Deel Advance, which allows -- it's kind of like what a customer does, right? So you can get paid in advance of the payout date. They even offer like health insurance plans now. I think they white-labeled like some other insurance provider. So yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Got it. Interesting. Yes, it seems like there's a lot they can do from like a product perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. Yes. It's gotten a lot better over the year, that's for sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes sense. And how would you rate your experience so far with them, like on a scale of 1 to 10?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd say now it's like really maybe like an 8, 8.5. Yes, sorry. Yes, probably 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Got it. What's some feedback you have on the product? Like in terms of things they could do better, things they could improve or add to the product that's not currently there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. So I'd say there's probably two features. I think a lot of the stuff I like asked for, they get done really fast. But the two main ones are: one, the ability to actually generate reports. So payouts, like for accounting reasons and budgeting. Like right now, they sync it into QuickBooks, and it's not like varied. The QuickBooks, I think, they've recently done and improved a lot. But like right now, it's not flawless. So generating like imports and exports from Deel would be really great. I mean they don't even have to do any visualizations, like as basic as it gets would be fine.\n",
    "And then, secondly, I think the contractor management piece is still like not perfect. So bucketing it via like terminated contractors, like they have all this, but it's like not organized in a very obvious way. So like if someone's being terminated in 8 days, like you should be able to archive that person so that they're inactive or stuff like that. So I think those are my two like small asks. But overall, I think like they have addressed like most of what I've requested, at least.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. Got it. So like the international payout space, I was wondering if you ever looked a company called Tipalti?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. We looked at a lot of different ones. And for what it's worth, the reason why we spent so much time in this is because like we do a lot of -- I mean, more marketplace models. So like we have to get our supplier payout like in as efficiently as possible. And the reason why we went with Airwallex, first and foremost, was just the rates. Paying into China is like a very notoriously like difficult thing, we were built on TransferWise until they got their license revoked by the local government there.\n",
    "So it's like it's a very specific -- like you could kind of be specialized on that. And Airwallex is like what WeChat uses for like international payments. So it is, I think, an Australian company. So what we found is like they have the best, like the strongest rates by far. But we did look around quite a bit. I don't think we like went full-on into an RFP or any big trial, we did like take a quick look. But I mean, I think, at that time, we were already pretty committed to Airwallex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. What about for like the Europe business? You said you used Payoneer and PayPal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "So Europe, on the supplier side, we actually tried to centralize as much as possible on the Airwallex since we've built like a lot of integrations around their API end points. But we've historically reviewed TransferWise a couple of times for like one-off payments. Yes, that's probably the minimum I can -- like, yes, TransferWise, we use once in a while. And of course, there's like PayPal for Western Europe and Payoneer for Eastern Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. And does Airwallex provide better rates in even like Western Europe and other countries as well outside of China?\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "That, I don't think it's like as aggressive. I think China rates got like really, like in sort of single-digit percentages sometimes. And I think in Western Europe, it's like everyone has pretty much the same rate. You should like look at the past user experience or what's like what's the easiest to use. So the reason why we use Airwallex for the Western Europe payment sometimes is just because of consolidation. Yes, we had to top-up our USD accounts in Airwallex, and then we converted them to send just because we want to use that down into Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. And in terms of user experience, curious like who you would kind of rate as the best one across those you just mentioned. So like Airwallex, Payoneer and PayPal, there's a few other ones you mentioned, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say the best 2 are PayPal and -- actually, no, #1 is, in my opinion, TransferWise. TransferWise is probably the, like the most seamless. It is not like the most comprehensive in terms of coverage, but like the user experience was very strong. #2 would probably be like either PayPal or Veem. Yes. And Veem's okay.\n",
    "So the rates aren't great, but like they're fine. And then I think like -- I'd say like everyone else kind of follows. Like Payoneer's user experience is awful. It's so hard to use it, like it's kind of, yes, they like to be paid with. And yes, so actually, Airwallex is not like friendly either. It's like pretty intense. It looks pretty but like it's very confusing on how to use it. So you have to spend a lot of time like getting used to the software, but people do it because of the fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Okay. Got it. So I guess it's like you're building a lot of stuff on Airwallex because they have really good fees in China. You have a lot of new business in China.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "But I guess, like if that weren't the case, you probably wouldn't have--\n",
    "\n",
    "Founder/CEO at Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, exactly. Right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Awesome. Well that’s all the questions I had today. This was super helpful. Thanks for taking the time with me and have a great rest of your week.''']"
