Your sister tells you to not do anything about it, saying you will pass anyway, your mother tells you to study the entire night before with little sleep so you have it all crammed in your mind, and your father says to study, get good sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, and believe in yourself. You take your fathers advice and ace the test. But if you didn't get multiple people to give you advice, you would be stuck with your sisters, which really isn't the best guidance ever. I believe seeking multiple opinions on the matter you would like advice on is important because you can hear from other experiences, you can hear from wiser people, and you can compare and find an in-between if you don't like any of the advice you received.

First off, if you ask multiple people for advice, you will receive some from people with different experiences. If you ask for advice on how to fly a plane, asking a pilot with experience would result in a better answer than someone that has never even gone to the airport. The same thing goes for passions and hobbies. They will have enough experience to help you get quality advice. So asking multiple people for advice to get someone with experience is important.

Another point I'd like to make is that some people may be wiser or more well-educated than others. It may come off as rude, but its a good point. Asking a toddler for a good book to read would have a much different outcome than asking your grandfather. This kind of ties in with my ""experience"" point as well, as younger or less wise people may also have less experience. Asking multiple people for advice to get an educated person is also important.

Lastly, what if you do not like any of the advice you received? Well, with multiple points to work off of, you can find a compromise for yourself. This also works if you like all of the advice you've gotten. If you don't like any or if you want it all, you can compare all of the advice you've been told and do the best thing for you. So yes, getting multiple views can help by getting ideas to work off of.

In conclusion, seeking and receiving multiple opinions and advice can be, and is, very important. It is important to find someone with experience. It is important to find someone with wisdom. It is very important to compare answers you've gotten to see which one you like best, or create your own depending on what you like from the advice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. ",4,1617820000000.0,1771,1779,"

To begin with limiting cars can help our environment. According to the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmissions just in Europe. By limiting cars that 12 percent can go to a 6 percent or mabe lower. To add to that cars make a very big amout of smog. In the passage "" Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" it says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog."" that has to be a huge amount of smog fo congestion to be down 60 percent! Most of that smog id made by cars. To limit cars is to limit Pollution.

In addition cars bring people down. In the passage "" Car-Free Cities "" they ban cars one of the citizens, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". As you can tell with no cars she is a happier person. Not only that but, in the passage ""Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said "" It's a goo opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" saying bye to cars helps ake away stress.

I believe that policy 1 is the best policy to enforce about cell phones. This policy will allow us to contact our parents or friends if needed. The use of cell phones in class is wrong but having them during lunch will not cause disruptions. Cell phones can be an annoyance during class but having them when not in class is perfectly acceptable.

Cell phones are disruptive to teachers and other students during class. If a phone goes off while others are trying to learn it interrupts their attention and annoys the teacher. However having cell phones during lunch or free periods would not disrupt any learning because you are not in a classroom. As long as cell phones are turned off and not being used during class time I see no reason why students should not be allowed to have them.

If a student gets sick or needs something having a cell phone with them can let them call home to contact someone. Even though they can call from the office having a cell phone on hand is a quicker and easier way to contact somebody. Also if a student has some kind of after school practice and can't have their phone with them at school then they won't be able to let their parent know if practice is running late or will finish early. Cell phones are necessary for students to have.

Policy 2 states that students can not have phones at school at all. If you choose policy 2 then students will still bring their phones and use them even more. Teenagers do what they are told not to do. If you tell us we can't have our phones that will just make us want to have them more. Policy 2 will just create more cell phone usage at school and more disruptions to the learning environment.

As you can see I believe that policy 1 is the best policy to enforce at this school. It will let students have their phones outside of class and they can have them if they need to contact some one. Even though cell phones are a nuisance to class this policy only lets you have them when you are not in class. Cell phones are necessary for contacting a parent or just for texting a friend. This is why policy 1 is the best policy for our school.

The smallest things can help students continue their education during break. This task can be made possible if students could design their own projects rather than relying on the teachers. The summer projects should not be teacher-designed because instructors control class and projects during the school year. One project that is student-designed will give the students a turn to control the expectations and rubric. If students could manage and design their own projects, it would give them an opportunity to create something that expresses their interests while enjoying their summer break.

When students are let out of school for summer break they are looking forward to the time off from school. The warm weather makes it fun to hang out with friends outdoors and go swimming. But if teachers were create and design a project for students to complete then that would be taking the fun out of summer break. It would be a hassle for students to be required to complete a teacher-designed project rather than the students designing the requirements and topic for the project. If the students have to take time out their summer to complete a project then it should designed by them. During the entire school year students are required to complete assignments at their instructors expense. Students are in school for more than half of the year, it is important that they can enjoy their lengthy summer break without being controlled by their teachers. If the students are required to complete a project during their summer break then it should be designed by the students. Summer break is meant to give students time to relax from stressful, hefty homework. It would be unfair to students if they were required to complete a project that was teacher-designed due to the importance for students to experience a stress-free break rather than worrying about due dates for assignments and tests.

Summer work is no fun for any student. It will be hard to convince any student to continue their education during their summer break because summer is all about no homework or projects. A way around that issue is giving the students a chance to complete the project at their own pace and interest. Any summer projects or assignments for students should be based around their interest rather than teachers interest. During the summer students will be busy having fun with friends, going on vacation or enjoying their time off from school. If a teacher assigns students an assignment or project that is not appealing, the chances of the students putting 100% effort into the project is slim. Also, the chances of students actually completing a teacher-based project efficiently is slim as well. But, if it was a student-designed project, the completion rate would skyrocket due to the fact the students would actually want to do the summer work. It will be hard for students to motivate and push themselves to complete a project if it is boring. Teacher-design summer work would be unfair to students that would like to control their education and topic. Projects and assignments based on the students interest would exemplify better work ethic and dedication. It is important for students to continue learning during the summer, but it should be learning based on their interests and goals rather than any teacher.

It would not be a good decision to let students design and control their own summer projects or assignments because it is important students are learning the correct material necessary for class. It would be pointless for students to complete a summer assignment or project if it was not based on the school's curriculum. A teacher-designed project would be more beneficial for the students than allowing the students to design their own project, The instructors are aware of the things the students will be required to learn during the school year. If the teachers would be allowed to control the summer work then it would give the students a head start on the upcoming material in their classes. Overall, the teacher's should control the requirements and rubric for the summer work because the students would learn things that are related to school rather than researching things that are irrelevant to anything they would be exposed to during the school year.

Moreover, students should be given the freedom to choose any topic for their summer work rather than letting the teachers design the projects. Summer is about free time and preparing for the next school year to come. But, if students had to worry and stress about a difficult, teacher-deigned project then it would be sucking the fun out of summer break. It would be unfair for teachers to require students to complete an assignment based on the instructors expectations.

Also for some kids it may be hard to fit one into their schedule, they may not have transportation to and from the activity, or they could just not want to do an extra activity.

First, some kids might have to do things after school that wouldn't leave any time for an extracurricular activity. They may have to take care of younger siblings while their parents are at work.

In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track (Ph. 3). Although this was the first concept of a ""smart car"", the roads would need an unrealistic upgrade that would cost extremely to much. Today however, we have the technology to make real driverless cars. The toll of human error has been evident in the auto-age as more accidents happen every year. The use of driverless cars, or at least almost driverless cars, will be benificial to the future as less accidents will happen, preventing more casualties.

Today, many cars all across America and the world have road assistance and antilock breaks, but this still gives drivers the oppurtunity to make a mistake and cause an accident. For example, BMW created a system called "" Traffic Jam Assistant"". The car is capable of handling situations at speeds up to 25 mph. This is not bulletproof though, as the human driver still has to be alert when navigating through construction and accidents. Developers though, are getting closer to having real driverless cars. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time (Ph.10).

Technology today makes creations and inventions capable of almost anything. We have had extreneous experience with sensors and radar, two things that are almost required for a driverless car in the upcoming future, to make one. In the 1980's, more than 30 years ago, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes (Ph. 5). With all of the experience gained, we now can make real driverless cars. Infact, we all ready have. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 (Ph. 2). Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but roadblocks and problems do lie ahead for a true ""driverless car"".

Traffic laws are written with the asssumption that the only safe car has a human driver in contral at all times (Ph. 9). As a result, many states restrict the use of driverless cars on the roads. As driverless cars are a relatively new idea, restrictions will be diminished in due time. Opposers of driverless cars have also made the claim that liability will possibly be the dimise of driverless cars. The discussion of whether or not the human in the seat or the car manufacturer will no doubt be on the minds of lawmakers, but they would quicky come to the conclusion that it would be the driver's fault, since the driver bought the car and knew what he/she was getting into. Manufacturers would also make a liability agreement required in order to driver the car.

Although driverless cars will not probably be 100% driverless, the creation of almost driverless cars is not far down in world history. The use of driverless cars, or at least almost driverless, will be beneficial to the future as less accidents will happen, preventing more casualties.

It can give them time to be with friends and can also give them the chance to met new people. And it can bring the teachers and students closer to each other. This would give them the chance to get to know each other and try new things out.

Extracurricular Activity's would be so helpful to the school's community. This program can also help kids not be on their phones as much. it would help kids come all together and work as a team. I feel like now in days kids dont really care about there Schools Extracurricular Activity's. I feel like a lot of kids\teens depend on this phones for answers, ideas, and etc. these ideas will show them that there are better stuff then just being on your Phone, iPad, and Computer.

These school activity's will probably also bring students and teachers closer. Student's most of the time dont like school so these Activity's can show them that school can be fun. These activity's will give kids a chance to see the bright side of school and also the true meaning. It will also teach kids that trying new things out with new people can be fun. These programs can really make a kids or teens life a huge impact.

Extracurricular Activity's can show kids how to be more outgoing and bring the shy kids out of the shy zone. These Activity's can teach kids so many life lessons. It help kids and teens who think they are lazy turn into great students. These Activity's can inspire students to do better in school and lift there grades up. It can help kids/teens find out what they truly love and what they truly dislike.

I feel that we should change the Electoral collage to a direct vote. As the author states in source 2 ""Under the Electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors.."" I believe the people should have a better say in who gets to run the USA. We should aboilish the electoral collage because people need to be able to vote for the president himself not his slate of electors. Also some electors don`t actually vote for who they are representing, And the electoral collage is just not fair.

The people should have a better say in who their president gets to be. They shouldn`t be voting for the Slate electors, but should be voting for the president. Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states. That`s just not right at all.

Belive it or not some of the electors dont even vote for the president they are representing. It doesn`t make any sense to do that. The electors should be voting for who they represent. That just increases my points value. The people should be able to vote for who they want.

The electoral collage is just unfair. The state legislators pick the electors, and some of those electors could always defy the qill of the people. It is unfair to the voters mainly because of the winner take all system, They mainly only focus on the swing states. Sometimes people get confused about the electors anf vote for the wrong canidate.

Many people can`t figure out if they want to get rid of the Electoral collage are keep it in place.

This halt can cause students to fall out of the rhythm of daily learning and cause them to forget material taught during the previous school year. This is why schools started implementing Summer projects to keep students engaged in learning. Summer projects have been traditionally designed by teachers but some people argue that students should be designing these projects. Teachers should be designing the Summer projects because they know more about the material, they would make it challenging enough, and it would be an easy and simple process.

One reason teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because they know more about the material. Many of these teachers have been teaching this information for a couple years. This means that these teachers have a good idea of what the students know from this school year and what information they should be prepared for in the coming school year. This information would greatly aid in making the Summer projects because the teachers would know how to format it in a way that students are familiar with but also prepares them for the new information that will be presented in the next school year. This would be very helpful to kids because it sets them up for success in the next year.

Another reason why teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because they would make it challenging enough. If kids tried to create a Summer project, it would most likely result in an easy assignment that would take no effort. This would destroy the entire purpose of the summer assignment and give no benefit to the student. But if teachers designed it, then it would more likely be a project of an acceptable rigor. The projects needs to be challenging enough that it keeps kids engaged in learning so they will benefit from it.

The last reason teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because it would be a easy and simple process. If a couple teachers get together and make the Summer project it would be easy for them to make a rubric to go along with it. If the students make the Summer project then it would be much more of complicated .

The students would most likely have to brainstorm ideas and pick one for the project which would take time, then pitch the idea to the teachers and wait for approval, and then after all that is done the teachers have to use a project that they did not make to create a rubric for grading. This seems like a lot of extra work when it could easily be simplified by the teachers creating the project.

Some people may argue that if the kids design the project they will be more engaged and willing to complete it, but the pros of teachers creating the project definitely outweigh the cons. Summer projects are extremely helpful and important to students learning experience. This is why it is so important that these projects are well constructed and thought out.

157882,AAAXMP138200001154132810_OR,708226E85CD6,train,"I think asking other people for help is a good idea especially asking several people. When asking more than one person for their own opinion it make's you look at the situation in different view points. If you need advice for something one person might say something completely different from what you thought of. Where somebody else might say what exactly you were thinking. When asking several people for the same advice or their opinions it will make you not only think more about the subject but it also helps you with different view point. One person will have a negative side to it and the other person will have a positive side to it so you would be able to think what's the worst that could happen or what's the best that could happen.

Personally I think it's better to ask more than one person, because you might be going through something and somebody gives you their advice, it almost is like they give you their strength to do it. I think as an example: say you are getting bullied, but you dont wanna tell on them because you are scared. You might go to a friend and ask for advice and you friend might say you need to tell on them, because if you tell on them they will stop but if you don't tell on them, they will continue to do it. If you have advice to do it from a friend more than likely you will go and tell on the bully or whatever your scenario is.

In my personal opinion helping somebody else always may not only make you feel good but it also helps your friend once their problem is solved or at least been helped. When asking for advice, or somebodies opinion it could really help you out. When asking one person for their opinion might not help you as much as asking several people for their opinion. When asking several people for their opinion, it helps you a lot more by not only giving you extra help but by making you think harder and look at it in different ways.

Asking your friend for their own opinion might not always be good because some people make bad decisions and might tell you to do something that will get you in trouble. In this situation you have to look at the pros and cons to the subject or to what they told you for their opinion or advice. If you think about what they told you if it was good it might and probably will help you. There so, when asking somebody something always think about it before you do it. I always think about what I do before I do it, because if somebody gives you advice that might get you in trouble and or put you in a bad place to get hurt or even worst that would be your fault in the end.

When somebody is asking you for help or is asking for advice they want you to help them. The person giving advice wants what is best for you so always go with what they said once you explain your situation or what you want. I would ask the person first and say why do you give that advice, or why do you say that, or why is that your opinion and see if they can back up their answer with a good reason.

Although smoe popele think that this is is not avery good idea there many advantages to driverless cars. These cars are safe, well tested, and very helpfull.

Some peole will argue that the cars might malfunction and crash or not know if there is a work zone and i needs to go slower. Driverless cars are not fully driverless. Although these cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is still a driver. As it said in the artical, "" all are desinged to noify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This would be like if there was a work zone at this point the car would alert the driver and he/she would have to take over. in the artical it states that the comepanis that arer making these cars have added a way of notifing the driver. Some of the formes of alerting the pasenger is by, vibrating seets, announcing that he or she should be prepered, and flash lights on the window shield. They have even thought of using cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention.

Also these cars have not just reacently came out of the factory and put on the streets. Google has been working on its driverles cars since 2009. Acording to the artical, ""their cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash. Yet, thier car is not compleatly driverless, there is still a human that takes over pulling in and oout of driveways or in complicated traffic issues. The thought of driverless cars has been here since the 1950s in the artical it states that, 'in the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electric cable that sent raidio signals to a reciver on thfront end of the car. ' So then since the 1950s scientest and engineers have been working on and improving this consept of driverless cars. That is more then sixty years of resherch and work inorder to make and sime perfect these cars.

After and when driverless cars are finaly perfected they will have many significant uses. For example, public transportation, every where you go there is public transportation and it is a big need expesualy in the big cities. in this passage it states that, the cars would use half of the fule of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility then a bus."" This would change the world, if cars are diverless it would give the human a great advantage. Also in a fun perspective when people go on long road trips they can normaly just drive for about eight houres before they need to rest. With driverless cars the car would do all the work aposed to the driver.

In conclusion driverless cars are coming and are a great thing. They will be safe for all users, provide great benifits, and have been well reasherched and worked on. They are a thing of the future and we are finaly there. Driverless cars are a thing everyone should look forward fore.                                 ",4,1621630000000.0,288,303,"very helpfull.

I don't like the idea of when joining sports you need a average of a B grade .....

WANTS to play sports for school....

All im asking is a little support in trying to switch from getting a B average to getting a C average to be able to play sports.... and i promise you the school report cards will not be disappointing ...... because i know if i wanted to play volleyball really badly id do anything in my power of doing good on my grades... and that's what i will be doing for this quarter shooting for my goal in playing a sport by getting a C average grade if you change it ....

Breathing is something every living thing has to do to survive. At that another question. Have you ever made the connection between driving and breathing? Pollution is the connection, in europe twelve percent of the green house gases are from the muffler.

In the extreamest of places like Beijin there is so much exhaust in the air that you can see it. They call this smog, smog is very dangerous, breathing large amounts could easily lead to lung cancer.

Hot Wheelz, battery-powered Barbie SUVs, Hess Semi-trucks, and other deviations of play-friendly cars introduce the car culture to Americans from nearly the first day out of the womb. Mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, neighbors, and grandparents depend on their cars daily. This reliance on cars consequently impacted America's environment. However, limiting car usage reduces society's carbon footprint, slowly eliminating the encompassing pollution and stress of the developed car culture.

All vehicles alike release carbon emissions into the atmosphere, polluting the air and smogging our cities. Suburbs, especially, rely on automobiles to provide needed transportion. Experts state that car transportation in suburbs ""is a huge impediment"" (Source 1) when discussing ""efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" (Source 1). In the car-intensive areas of the United States, passenger cars hold responsibility for ""up to 50 percent"" (Source 1) of greenhouse emissions. This constant car usage pollutes American skies. Elisabeth Rosenthal states that car usage reduction ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Source 4), especially in America ""since transportation is the second larget source [of emissions]"" (Source 4). Cutting down on cars for alternative, public, or group transportation provides a solution to the car epidemic of suburban America.

In other societies where limitations of car usage occured, the majority of its denizens replied positively. In the car-depleted suburb of Vauban, Germany, ""57 percent sold a car to move [to Vauban]"" (Source 1). The influential idea of a suburb without traffic jams and long drives to stores attracted 5,500 current residents of Vauban. Futhermore, car bans in Paris reduced emissions and cleansed the air ""after days of near-record pollution"" (Source 2) and ""five-days of intensifying smog"" (Source 2). During this ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent"" (Source 2), relieving traffic and pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a ""car-free day"" (Source 3) promotes ""alternative transportation and reduce[s] smog"" (Source 3). One Colombian businessman commented cheerfuly, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (Source 3). The relief of traffic results in the relief of stress, which city-drivers appreciate.

In America's evolving society, and the evolving global economy, limiting car usage stands benefically.

In many countries most children do not have a choose of whether or they want to up out the community. But, if u look at those children from other countries they are all responsible, and know how to act in public. Not saying all Americans are bad but, that we take things for granted. I believe that children should do community service it can help them understand that not everything is easy but, that everything it is not just handed to you. Maybe i should go into details.

I go to school everyday and watch children act a fool and be disrespectful to their teachers. So i think that it's because at home these children do not have anyone telling right from wrong but, not only that they have no responsibly at home. They all get away with to much and mostly come home play video games, get on Facebook, and thing like that. So maybe if the school help them understand that life isn't easy just maybe these children will be a bit better.

With that said you can probably see how trilled I am to see schools try and make a difference in these kids life show them that the bad habits you have now you will mostly have later in life and not everyone going to put up with it. Even thought I am with the idea i still have to put myself in their shoes because, some of these kids have seen stuff that I never plan on seeing.

Also is this community service during school hours and if so don't you think it would be taking away from our learning time I mean responsible is great to have. It might not such a great thing if u do not know how to read, write or do simple math. So I believe that children just need a little bit more responsible in their life to learn to make better choices.

If you join the program you can take care of animals,play games on your free time,and go to new or exciting places. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy I did those things. Being a Seagoing Cowboy means that you would have to be on a cattle-boat going to different places.

On the cattle-boat I had to take care of some animals. I took care of horses,young cows (calfs),and mules. Sometimes, I have to check on the animals every hour as a night watchman. I have to feed the animals two or three times a day. I had to clean the animal stalls too.

On the trip, I would get free time. When I get free time I found some fun things to do. I did these things:table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. Other Cowboys played baseball and volleyball I played those too.

While sailing I went to lots of places. I went to places like Venice,Italy and China. Going places is part of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I went to places in Europe too.

This is because the activities can provide students with life long important tools. For the benefit of the students, I believe that kids should be pushed to participate in extracurricular actives. I believe this will benefits the students in a variety of ways that include making new friends, being more productive, and allowing for more success in life.

One of the main reasons that making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be beneficial to students is the fact those activities allow for new friendships to be created. This is true because most extracurricular activities allow students to talk with each other, and talking with a person is the first step towards friendship. One of the biggest issues facing teenagers is depression, but if they had a place that made them feel comfortable that would help. An extracurricular activity would be perfect to make them feel like they belong. Those friends would also most likely stay with them their entire lives.

A second reason making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be helpful is it could allow them to be more productive. This is because most extracurricular activities are only open for a small amount of time after-school, for anything fun to be accomplished they would have to be productive. Some activities like working on the yearbook, and student council have deadlines, which can teach students how or why to be productive in school. Teaching students about deadlines can also go in their future by preparing them for a college or a job.

The third main reason that making students participate in extracurricular activities is positive is it allows them to feel successful. It is important for them to feel successful because they will strive to be successful in other aspects of their lives allowing for more success that can also help them in the long term. One being if they join a good club then they can place that on their resume for college, allowing them to get a good job. On the contrary, if they didn't want to or couldn't afford college the club could go right on their resume in order for them to join the work force.

In conclusion, we should make students participate in extracurricular activities for many reasons, but the three most prominent being it will give them the chance to make friends, teach them about productivity, and will allow for success even after school has ended for them. Extracurricular activities allow for a students to create meaningful lasting friendships. They also allow for students to learn the importance of productivity for the future. The activities teach students how to be successful and why for short term and long term goals.",4,1615850000000.0,240,352,"For the benefit of the students, I believe that kids should be pushed to participate in extracurricular actives.

153801,AAAXMP138200001316162810_OR,3FDDD603DDF5,train,"Have you ever asked advice from anyone? How many times have you asked? Asking advice is pretty important if you're one of those people that depend on people to make your decisions. But why should we ask multiple people for advice?

Well lets start off by how advice is important. Advice is a suggestion or recommendation that a person gives to you in order help in your decision-makings. It can affect your life greatly by which choices you make. So that's why it's important to get feedback from multiple people. Once you have gathered information from other people, you can compare other people's responses with others to see what would be good or bad. One example was when I asked my friends which sports I should play. I came up to at least 10 or more of my friends for advice. Then I compared some answers with others. And it seems that a lot of people thought I was good a Basketball. So I tried it out, and it was the perfect sports for me. But still, why should we ask multiple people for advice?

We rely on others everyday in our lives. Either by life choices or just helping people. There are many ways to help people, but we mostly help people with advice. Asking several different people is a great way to get advice. You could ask you parents, friends, uncles, anybody! Recently, I went on a trip to the mountains. I was either deciding if I wanted to ski or snowboard when I got there. Wasn't sure of my decisions, I asked my family members and friends. out of 8, 6 said skiing because it was easy and it was my first time. So I agreed. Opinions can vary when asking many different people. It's good to ask for many different opinions. Otherwise you won't come out with a good outcome. Another example could be during science class. Sometimes you have to try the experiment 50 times in order to make your final outcome or decision.

Why should we ask multiple people for advice? How does it benefit you? As a result of asking many people for their opinion, many people have matured in life making better choices. This benefits us as a person when we grow up to make our own decisions. So that's why advice can really be important in tough choices. So always try to get advice from your peers when you need it.",4,1617730000000.0,1603,1698,It's good to ask for many different opinions.

I think it would be best if you asked different people for their opinions. Seeking for multiple peoples' advice is a benefit because you'll hear different parts of the situation, you could hear form an expert, and you will be more of an extroverted person.

First, you will be able to hear many different sides of the story. This is amazing because you will hear from so many different peoples' opinions, if you have more opinions you will have a better understanding of the topic. Who does not want to hear from different peoples opinions? Also, it would be cool if we could hear different sides of the story. Those are my reasons why it's good to hear many different sides of the situation.

Next, you can hear form an expert. There are many type of experts, and I think that you could find an expert on your topic. Plus, when you hear from an expert you will be more informed and know a lot more than you did. With the expert you could list pros and cons. These people know a lot about the our situation and could help us a lot. Those are a few from many reason for it to be good when hear from an expert.

Lastly, you will more of an extroverted person. The main thing is that you are always socializing, so it will be a lot easier to talk to people. Which is so cool because if you are always asking people for their opinions you will not be afraid to ask people for help, that is something a lot of teens need to learn how to do. Who does not want to talk to other people? Something else is that you will become more of a nicer because you will be learning some social skills.

Not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in an another way. Along with this, this technology could introduce a lot more job intrest, hobby intrest, or just pure intrest among students. Lastly, this technology would be beneficial to students because it would give us a reason to be taught about the science of emotion, we could learn and go more into depth about our basic human body and mind and how easy emotions can show.

This technology can change lessons for kids who aren't understanding, or are just completley bored of the material being shown. This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. From paragraph 6 the author stated, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Ending the conversation with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work.

Secondly, the FACS can show students a different range of technology that is fairly new. It could show some kids something they may be passionate for but never knew of, it could be a possible job intrest, a new hobby interest, anything at all. The people using this technology are doing so many things, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;"" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements."" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.

Lastly, having this technology in our school would give us a reason to talk about the basic science of emotion. We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8. Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers.

Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct.

When I need advice I like to ask multiple people because each person has different opinions,you have different types of advice to pick from, and helps you make a better decision. Each person has their own opinion on things. Well each person you ask for advice will have their own opinion on it. I know when I ask my relatives for advice each one of them will say something totally different than the other person. Also when you hear advice form someones else's mouth it's probably sounds way different in your mind when someone else says it. It is easier to ask someone for advice when you need it. Sometimes you should ask yourself you can probably make up your decision on your own. So hearing someone else's opinion on advice can really help you understand it more. For me hearing someone else's point of view on advice help's me understand it and know more about it. There is also so many ways advice can help people in so many different ways. Different opinions that people give you are a lot, but some of them can really help you. Every person you ask has something different to say;then you can pick either one you think is right for you. When I get multiple advice from friends or relatives I usually think them through and then eventually I pick the right one. Different opinions means more to choose from and more to think about. Getting multiple advice an opinions means you have to think about it more, and it's going to cause more stress to your body. So obviously different opinions can throw you off a bit ,but some can get you through a lot. For instances kids can tall you from their experiences that something is good and that you should try it, but you know in you head that it's not at all good for you. So thats why hearing good advice can help you make great decisions in your life. Making decisions are hard thats why when you ask for other people's advice maybe it will make it easier for you. Decision making can be very stressful to some people, when they have to make a huge decision or even if it's as little as making a decision on whether you should wear pants or shorts today. Every person or kid I know don't like making decisions either it's to hard for them or they are too lazy and don't care. All o these decision making is going to make you head hurt and make you stress out. I'd take the advice from all of the people you have asked and come to your conclusion on your decision. Another way advice can help you make decisions in you life time is when you need to decide if you want to something spontaneous with your friends. Like if your friend ask you if you wanted to go to the bathroom with her and her friends to vape a vape pen before class. You shouldn't fall into their peer pressure to do something that isn't good for your body.

Although all of these things about getting advice from other people some of it can mean something way different to other people. Getting advice from people can be a little bit scary because they can say the total opposite of what you want to say to you. So make sure whenever you are getting advice from someone or someone is giving you advice to keep in mind that they can say whatever they want to. Now getting advice is a lot to take in but hopefully hearing from my point of view about getting advice from other people. Really helps you when someone is giving to you advice or even you giving advice to someone else. I feel like you now know that getting advice can mean so many things to some people.

Students would benefit from online learning because it would be easier to focus, they would have more free time, and it can be used when regular schools are not available. Online school has been considered recently and could be coming very soon. If it happens, we could see if it really benefits students in as many ways as we think. Having online school could be a short term solution or as a permanent solution.

During school, many students can lose focus due to the amount of time they spend in school. By having online school, the usual 7 hour school day would be shortened because of the limitations of online school. Spending 7 hours in school tires the mind and with online school, students can work at their own pace. Students would work better in an environment they are more comfortable with like their bedrooms. The added benefit of being able to take a break whenever would allow students to sleep in instead of having to wake up early in the morning.

Having online school would give students more free time for other activities like sports or hobbies and would remove the stress that comes with school. With free time on their hands, students could do other things they normally would not be able to like apply for jobs, practice sports, and spend time with friends. Students that work or are involved with sports do not have much time to complete assignments and can discourage students to take excelled classes. This limit of time can be stressful for students and many students end up staying up late in order to finish. By giving the students more free time to work or practice sports, students would be able to complete their work on time without stressing over it.

Online school can be used for a temporary replacement for regular school in times of emergencies. Students who are unable to attend school due to disease or injury would be able to keep up with the class through online learning. It could prove useful during times of disease outbreaks like corona virus. Instead of keeping schools open with a risk of infecting students and staff, schools would consider switching to online school for as long as it is needed. Schools could consider using online learning to make up for snow days as well.

Students would benefit from online school because it would be easier to focus, it would give them more free time, and it could be used as a temporary replacement if needed. Having online school temporarily or permanently would benefit students and teachers alike. The amount of time saved by using online school instead of regular school would be huge.

23386,AAAXMP138200000914922144_OR,41E45EFE43AA,train,"Summer projects are some of the most dreaded assignments to give to a student. However, they are very necessary in order for students to retain information needed for the following school year. Summer projects, involving schools, should be teacher-designed in order to optimize students's learning.

Firstly, a teacher knows what to assign best based on the class curriculum. If students were to all decide what the project was and how it should be done, then there would be a multitude of topics and confusion amongst the class. In seventh grade we were given a choice assignment to do. Although it was a fun project and allowed us to use creativity, it didn't lead us to the same information. In a summer project, the main purpose being to continue learning, a student-designed project may not be the best way to learn about a common topic.

Secondly, the school year would flow much smoother with a teacher-designed project. In my sophomore year I was assigned a summer assignment for world history. It was the same assignment given to the whole class, and was meant to be completed the same way as well. Completing it made it easier for my teacher and classmates to refer to as the year went on. Similar to a textbook, we all were able to use the same resource to make learning easier and allow the class to flow smoother.

On the contrary however, students may not have the time to complete a summer project in a specified way. During summer break it is very common for people to travel or have family in town. For example, every year I go out of town on road trips to visit family. This year my mom told me that we would be visiting family in Africa. Places like Africa may not have all the necessary resources to complete an assignment the exact way a teacher asks. Even if a student were to have resources available, constant travel may limit a student's time and ability to focus. Students may have to get creative and modify or design their project in a way that would allow them to complete it before the beginning of the school year.

Lastly, If a student were to design his or her project, they would likely take the easy route in order to enjoy the rest of their summer. Although I have many positive qualities, I am known to take the easy route when it comes to a lot of things. In my fifth grade science fair we were allowed to decide our own experiments to do. Instead of trying to think of a topic that may attract viewers at my booth, or something that interested me, I chose the most basic experiment I could think of, ""which paper airplane would fly the farthest."" When it comes to school students are prone to rush through any work given. Like myself, they'd take the easy route and limit their own capabilities.

Summer projects are important for schools and teachers to implement whether it be student-designed or teacher-designed. However in the case of productivity, teacher-designed projects bear more benefits. School year flow, class content, and a student's work habits all play roles in why teacher-designed projects should be the main source of assignments given over the summer.",5,1618580000000.0,2053,2181,"If a student were to design his or her project, they would likely take the easy route in order to enjoy the rest of their summer ",Claim,Claim 3,Effective,1618580000000.0,"Summer projects, involving schools, should be teacher-designed in order to optimize students's learning.",Position,Virginia,Independent,,Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

18081,AAAXMP138200000575912144_OR,C0459F75A8DB,train,"Most schools in the United States require students to complete a summer project. Projects are assigned over the summer to assure students are learning over the long break. Most students want to enjoy their break without any school work and wait until the last week of summer break to complete summer projects. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects are student-designed, students will be more creative, it gives students a senses of independence, and students will be able to explore areas of interest.

However, some may disagree and say summer projects should be teacher-designed. They argue for this because if projects are student-designed they may off topic. This is a valid argument because it would make no sense if a student in a science class did a project about Fredrick Douglass. This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow. Nevertheless, their are other view points to consider.

On the other hand, if summer projects were student-designed they would be more creative. Students would not be restricted and could express themselves in unique ways. In the last few decades or so, the government has made standards for students to meet. With theses standards in places teachers have to follow a very strict curriculum. More than ever before, teachers are teaching to the test which limits student creativity. With student-designed summer projects, students can express their creativity which they are limited to in the school year.

In addition, allowing summer projects to be student-designed would let students to feel independent. As most students are restricted during the school year to a classroom, allowing students to design their own projects could mean they go to a local park and explore their community. In Tara Westover's memoir

Educated , as a young girl she did not explore her community as a child due to her parents beliefs. As she grew up she wanted to go to college and experience something new. When she went to college it was very rewarding. This is because she was not restricted any more. Allowing students to design their own project could be a very rewarding feeling for them because of the independence they gain through it.

Finally, if summer projects were to be student-designed it would allow students to explore areas of interest that may not correlate to a specific subject in school. If a student wanted to do a project about fast fashion, it does not make sense to do it in a world history, algebra, biology or band class. That is why it is beneficial to students if they design their own summer project. A student-designed summer project allows students to research a topic they might not be able to do in their classes during the school year.

To conclude, letting students to design their own summer project is beneficial in more than one way. Students will be able to show off creativity that they might not show off in school. Student-designed projects gives students a sense of independence because they are not being told what to do. It also allows student to explore topics that are not taught in school.

Now, have you ever heard of the ""Face on Mars?"" If you have, then this is going to explain to you why the Face is a natural landform and not some monument created by aliens.

When NASA first saw the ""Face on Mars"" they claimed they spotted what the text states, ""the shadowy likeness of a human face."" The image was found when they were snapping photos of possible landing sights for Viking 2, one of NASA's spacecrafts circling the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The passage later states, ""But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" The scientits even said it was just a landform. They stated that it has,""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The scientists are not saying it's a alien monument either. They are just saying people could petray it that way.

A few days after this discoery NASA unveiled the image. When they unveiled it there was a capiton under it reading, ""huge rock formation."" NASA said the formation resembles a head and was formed by shadows giving the illusion of the facial features. This just made the Face a publicity stunt for most people. This might be when most would believe that it is some sort of a alien monument. But then NASA passed over the Face again and this time took a phots much greater then the last.

On April 5, 1988, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the ""Face on Mars."" They snapped picutres ten times sharper then before. The text states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site."" Thouands waited for the photo and what the photos unveiled were the truth. The photos revelead a natural landform, not any alien monument. Some people still believed that the structure was still an alien monument. But NASA learned that not all will believe.

All this evidence is just showing you that it is a natural landform. They have coordinates of this landform. They have amazing pictures just showing you that this is real. Even scientists examining the photos and showing exactly how what it is. What is it you must ask? It's a landform. NASA knew not all would believe but it made no sense to them.

Scientists have proved that the face on Mars was created by a huge rock formation. The image taken on Mars in 1998 revealed that the face is really just a natural landform. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all. Perhaps people wanted to think the face on Mars was created by aliens just so it couold be a good story for a magazine or Hollywood film, but that is not true.

This would benefit students with any medical issues, or family/home life issues; They could still continue schooling and receive their diploma without stepping foot inside a school building.

A child suffering from any physical or mental instabilities or frequenting hospital time would highly benefit from distance learning. A student should not feel the stress of falling behind in school or failing classes, when they should be focused on healing themselves and remaining healthy and happy. At no point in time should a student feel the need to put their own physical or mental well being aside so that their school work should survive. If a student has any issues such as needing to stay in hospital or home the online or video conferencing would be a way of continuing social contact in education, furthering education, but also extending brain development, and taking their minds off the present situation, which they most likely dont wish to be in. Of course in some medical emergencies or severe health situations there are complications by which distance learning would not work at all and continuing schooling wouldnt be first concern. Mind over matter in which, mind not only stands for its self but also the human body, and matter is anything other than that.

Many children suffer from problems not of the outside world but of issues that stem from their home environment and people contributing to their home life. In a situation where a child may live not in a location close to any schools, though rare, may happen because of a parent or guardians decision. A child may have to watch younger siblings or take care of grandparents, though social norms say a child not be put in such situations so that they may not attend school; But for some that is their way of life that family comes first, and that is the way that parents or guardian wish to raise their child. Or that a students parents live a life so that they move or travel frequently, because of a military career or government positioning. In these conditions the child should not be punished for their parent or guardians lifestyle or what they chooses to value, they should have a fair chance at schooling just as any other child receives.

Whenever you go up you always have to come back down in some way. Meaning that there is always cons or failures in this way of education. A student may cheat, because they have no educational instructor to watch over them as they do school work. Or that some students may take advantage of this program so that they dont have to go to school. But they are choosing their life in those moments and if a students wishes to cheat or not attend, when thrown into their future the only person that is hurting in the end is their selves.

In the end I believe that the pros out weight the cons in the amount of students that this program would help and change their lives for the better, highly out weights those who would take advantage.

That sounds like a very lazy excuse.

Of all the things you could've said, you said aliens.

There's more proof that it is just a formation other than an alien.

Your mind will change after you read this.

By the way, do you realize that the ""Face of Mars"" is a pop star?

First off, there is no trace of aliens on the planet.

NASA has been saying for years that it wasn't aliens that did it.

Why would NASA lie to the whole world?

Also, why would aliens make a human face?

It is just a huge rock formation that resembles a human head and that has been proven.

These kinds of thoughts always happen because of the media.

They always make something different from what it really is.

Now a lot of people think that NASA is keeping information from them, and that there is life on mars.

Whenever the media gets the chance to say something about aliens, they always take that chance.

Why do you people listen to everything you see or hear?

Isn't it dumb to think alien exists?

Let's be honest, what real proof do we have of aliens?

The fact the huge rock formation looks like a human face is just a coincidence.

Just because something has to do with space, doesn't mean aliens have to be a part of it.

When people seek multiple opinions it can help someone make better choices. i agree with this because people attend to help others and be there with you when you need someone to talk to. And also help you to make better choices for you.

My first reason is that it helps you think what choices are best for you when you need them. second, people that know you well like for an example your family, knows what's right or wrong for you. so you dont have to worry of what they're going to say. Because they know that they wont make you think more. finally, you will hear multiple opinions to hear from. Until you feel that you agree with any opinion. and knowing that it could help you prevent anything that could happen in the future when you need it.

My second reason is that it could help you get rid of the negative thoughts and thinking less when you know you have multiple advice and opinions. second, the more people you have by your side are the best choices you make. because they support you and will give you great advice. And also giving small talks (advice). because they know how you feel and know what you like to hear from others. finally, it could help to improve ideas and thoughts you might ve had in your head. because you think how you plan out your ideas without making a mistake.

My third reason is you have a chance to make better choices when you get advice from others. And it could also help not to make mistakes. And that the one of reasons you get advice is because you learn from your mistakes whether its something bad or good. second people who offer you advice, often could lead you to a right path. if you trust them.

And usually thinks if it's worth it or not. finally you dont have to be alone when you need advice because their always that one person that is there for you to talk to even if you dont seem them familiar.

We all ask for opinions right? and its normal that we do because it could help us during life. Not everybody gets that chance like we do because some people been doing by their own and thats totally fine you could also do that but having others help you and giving you multiple options is a way easier to get a better future i know not all of might not agree with that and its fine because all people have different ideas!.

In conclusion, advice could take people anywhere even if you dont believe me. But it does. having a good variety of choices is better than having none.

When your shopping you always wonder ''Am I getting the best price?''If not your crazy. If you do than this is one of the time multiple opinions that may help. Here is a example. your shopping for a car and the price that the dealer ship is supisously to high you would probably look for people who have that car and ask for an opinion on how much should I buy it for so you know your not being scammed out of your money or maybe you can find out a way to get a much better car at a far better price. The possibility are endless when it come to buying things. This here is another example. I have an interest in LEGOs but I always have trouble when shopping for them and its always the same problem. The price,LEGOs,they a very fun yet expensive toy,A medium sized set could be over $50! As a kid that would be all of my saving but i've found a way to get them for a far better deal than I could ever hope and I do this by asking several people during the time my neighborhood has garage sales to see if there is any way I could get my hand on some LEGOs at a great bargain that and you always have EBay.

Imagine your in school but the day before you where really sick and couldnt remember if you had a test or your homework due that that day well never fear communication is here and with it you can check all of your best sources like your friend Generic_Name or Generic_Name they are both sources you can rely on because there are your friend and they would never lead you astray,right? All jokes aside this could be super yes I said super and i'm not five but this is super helpful lets throw in another example. Your walking home when you get a text from a friend they say that spring break will now be two weeks long and your unsure but when you ask another friend and they say its two weeks long and so your convinced,but what you didnt know as well as your friends is that the school announcements were off and that there was just one week of spring break and so you now have been gone from school thinking that school was out but in reality you have just missed a whole week of school. The sad part of this story is it could have all been avoided if you just confirmed with a few more sources. This does not only apply to school though. They just the easiest of the examples.

Now I know there will be at least one person who will have no one to talk to even about this. Never fear thats why the internet is here! Seriously these day you have all of the knowledge and opinions in the world at your finger tips but not only that but hundreds of sources that will indeed confirm any question or help you with an problem or get you any advice you need. this is not the only way other than human way to ask questions and be able to confirm you answers with it books not thousands but millions of books to chose form some are for stories but many are for information,information that can be confirmed with even crossing over the internet and humans to get the best advice or information ever!

The Face is not a natural landform because it looks exactly like a face, its on Mars which could be an alien, and many roovers have seen the Face when they go to Mars.

The Face is not a natural landform because it looks exactly like a face. How can we not know that it is not an alien. NASA people can't go up to Mars to look at it face-to-face. Roovers can only take pictures of it. Mars is too far away that NASA can't send people up there to make sure it is an alien. There isn't any oxygen up there so people could breathe.

The Face is on Mars, which could be an alien. People have always thought that there were aliens on Mars. This time there actually could be one on Mars. Life on Mars could be a real thing. Mars is a eird place because it is red, unlike Earth which is mostly blue and green.

Cell Phones have become very important to our lives. People use their cell phones for everything; texting, talking and to get on social media. However, these everyday things become a distraction when it comes to driving on the roads. It has become a big issue in modern day America. As more teens text and drive, many cases of texting and driving have occured, resulting in a mass of avoidable lost lives.

In 2016, The national Safety council reported that 1.6 million car crashes a year are caused by reckless teen driving, most of which, are by texting and driving. Teens nowadays can't even put enough effort into not using their phones for at least 20 minutes, and for what cost, their lives? There has to be a kind of restriction on texting, or any kind of activity on your phone, while driving.

Some phones already offer some programs or apps that let you disable your phone while you drive. Drivesafe mode is a built in program that is available only on some phones. Although, most of the programs similar to Drivesafe mode, are supposed to be turned on by the user. This is simple to disregard, and most drivers don't even know they have such kinds of apps on their devices.

As of 2019, most states have gone to the point where they feel the need to ban texting and driving by using the word of law. The state of georgia put in place the ""Hands -free phone"" law which only allows drivers to operate voice controlled devices whilst driving. Still, even with the price of a hefty fine, and in some cases, jail time, people still continue to text and drive.

In conclusion, a good solution to ending deaths and accidents by teens who text and drive, starts with the parents. Parents should monitor their teens phones while they are out. Not only does the technology of today let parents spy on their kids phones just to keep them out of trouble, but it will help keep them alive, too. Parents should keep track of their kids while they go out, and alert them to stop when they text and drive. No one can tell you better than your own parents to stay alive.

107659,5150017_cleaned,DB6025F937EA,train,"Dear Mr. Senator,

Today I am asking for your favor of keepig the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This process now consists of the selection of the electors and meeting where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of votes by the congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, but only 270 of those votes are required to elect the president. I think that we should change the way that our citizens vote. I also think that we should update how the elections are run.

First of all, we should change the way that our citizens vote. When we vote for a president we are actually just voting for that Elector. So there is a possibility that the Elector could vote for the opposite president and your vote basically not be put in. I think that our citizens should have enough rights that they dont have to have Elector to do the voting for them and we can all just vote for who we want. For instance, it could be just all politics and the Electors get paid to vote for a certain person and thats why most of the presidents who get elected get elected today.

Secondly, We should update how the voting system works. Instead of it being 270 people out of 538, we should just have everyone one vote without Electors. Then everyone would have there say in the voting system and then they could just average it out or figure out the math of who won by percentage. For instance, take the number of all the people who voted for both presidents and take the number of one of the presidents and divide them by eachother and multiply it times 100. Then all the political stuff wouldnt happen because everyones vote counted. Maybe a change in the system would be a good idea.

Last but not least, In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford said that in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that vote would not have actually gone to Kennedy. So the Electors are not as reliable as everyone thought. Some Electors have also refused to to vote for there parties canidate. My honest opinion is to just change the Electoral College.

In conclusion, I am writting to you Mr. Senator in hopes that you can fix the Electoral College and change the election to a popular vote. If this were to happen, it could make our citizens have a little more rights. We may also update our system a little bit so that the election voting is a little more accurate so that everyone gets to get there vote in. Maybe this could be what solves most of the political problems in the world.

With all do respect i dont think having the electoral college is a proper way to nominate a president, or any senate for our country.

i strongly agree that we should have the idea of changing it to election by popularity. to be known as a good person or a good citizen in your state or anywhere you have to be a great rolemodel & an excellent example to our world. From what i discovered in a passage electoral college is unfair.

who are the electors ? and who picks out the electors ? it dependes on the state. voters sometimes vote for there electores but sometimes the voters get confused on who they voted on. somtimes the wrong candiate.

yes i do think that people who are running for president and senate should have the right to have a chance to become something big, but in my perspective i think that peoiple who is known and well common to there state will be a better outcome to whatever they run for. its like for an example, we live in the Florida state , we've know a woderful and handsome man that helps around our state and town of plant city,  giving us more and devoring most of his time helping the enviroment and creating a diffrence. The man would have a greater chance of being nomitanted to being a president unlike the other man who only came out of his shell a year ago and have no idea what this man is capable of. Who will we have better trust on?

When you win a contest or a bet we usally get what we accomplished for, when a elector wins , it takes all. well only the electoral collge works up on this. so please state senator, please change the process on how we are voting now, i think it would be alot more acceptable to vote on a preident on popularity. The united sates wants to be in the hands of a trusted person and someone the whole world can look upond.            ",2,1615510000000.0,162,249,i strongly agree that we should have the idea of changing it to election by popularity. ,Claim,Claim 1,Adequate,1615510000000.0,"With all do respect i dont think having the electoral college is a proper way to nominate a president, or any senate for our country.",Position,Florida,Text dependent,"Source 1: ""What is the Electoral College?"", by the Office of the Federal Register

29658,AAAXMP138200001835112144_OR,F7B97D4C1869,train,"Summer break, every students favorite time of the year. A time for late nights at the beach, hanging with friends, visiting family, and simply enjoying the time off. Almost everybody enjoys summer break but one thing we also can agree on is disliking the summer projects, and there's a debate on whether or not the projects should be student or teacher designed. Some way argue to say that the summer projects should be teacher designed because they're more professional, will focus on materials we may have forgotten about, and they'll make the projects straight to the point, but I feel as if the summer projects should be student designed because we'll be able to be creative, are most likely to remember to do the project, and can learn but yet still have fun.

The first reason summer projects should be student designed is because we can be creative with the projects. Majority of the times the projects are boring and require a lot of work. Having a boring project can cause students to be less likely to do it. Designing the projects ourselves will ensure that we not only understand how to do it but we also can enjoy doing it. Students would be able to come up with something that interests but also relates to the learning material to ensure we're learning also. Us being young adults means that we're young-minded and sometimes we don't understand the projects given from teachers because they don't think/see things like we would. Designing the summer projects ourselves will give students a chance to be creative in how they combine learning with still enjoying their summer and it may even help later on in the school year if teachers are able to see how well we come up with and work on things on our own. With that being said designing are own summer projects would give students a chance to show teachers what they're capable of.

Another reason why summer projects should be student designed and not teacher designed it because we'll be less likely to forget to do it and it'll get done faster. As I previously stated majority of the times the projects given to us are boring and may even be hard to understand for some students, Therefore designing them ourselves would eliminate the problem. Having a boring or hard summer projects often tends to make students more likely to forget about it or simply not do it at all. That could all change though because allowing students to make the projects themselves will boost them to want to do it knowing that it's something they choose to design. Automatically the projects would get done faster since students designed something they not only understand but enjoy also. When the students finish their projects fast that'll make it easier for the teachers to grade and get out the way so everyone can resume to enjoying their summer. Students designing their own projects would not only make it easy on their half but it'll be easy on the teachers half too.

Some still may argue though that summer projects should be teacher designed because they'll assign the correct learning material that they want us to work on and ensure that we don't forget. Teachers are of course more professional so they would automatically know what students commonly forget over break. Knowing what students forget they'll design work that will help us work on and remember commonly forgotten material. Designing assignments that we probably have forgotten about will help students when the school year starts because we'll hopefully remember the forgotten material by doing the summer project giving us a boost in school. Also they'll focus on mainly ensuring that we know the material instead on if we actually enjoy it or not. Teachers put their focus on ensuring the students can both understand and know how to do the material given.

In conclusion summer projects are important to ensure students know material they've forgotten but even though some may argue to say that the summer projects should be teacher designed because they're more professional, will focus on materials we may have forgotten about, and they'll make the projects straight to the point, but I feel as if the summer projects should be student designed because we'll be able to be creative, are most likely to remember to do the project, and can learn but yet still have fun.

161837,AAAXMP138200001201462810_OR,13426BBB0EC2,train,"A girl is deciding whether she should take her job offer. The job gives her many new oppourtinuties, but she is required to move away from her friends and family. Her friends are giving her mixed opinions, between staying here with them or following her dreams. Her family is telling her that she should take the job. The CEO of the company is begging for her to join them. She is extremely confused and doesn't know what to do. Asking many people for advice gives her a better platform for making her decision. If she had just asked for one opinion, she might have listened to it without hearing the other side. Getting advice from various individuals can help an individual get different opinions, see the pros and cons of each side, and also boost the chance that they see which choice is the best. When asking people for advice, it is better to seek multiple opinions in order to make the better choice.

Sometimes, when making a difficult decision, people are blind sighted and can not see all the possibilities at once. When first introduced to the decision, it is easy to just think of one obvious solution and go with it, but asking different people for their opinion can help create new ways to go about that decision. A couple years ago, my family and I were staying at an AirBnB on the beautiful main island of Puerto Rico. We were scheduled to depart for San Juan the next day, and then come back to the main island. However, we did not book anywhere to stay the night that we would come back. My mother frantically searched for unreserved hotels and AirBnBs, but nothing was available. After an hour of utter chaos, I asked Generic_Name, the owner of the AirBnB, suggestions on where we could stay. She said that we were more than welcome to stay at her place again, since it was not filled yet. If we did not decide to ask her about our dilemma, we might have ended up sleeping on a beach! More people being asked for advice causes more solutions to be unlocked.

After seeing all of the different decisions, it is helpful to consider every single one and what the impact of it would be. Someone might think that their decision of closing a grocery store is a great idea and will help the traffic flow better, but after talking to their peers, they might see that this idea could leave many people without a primary source of food. Not only does seeking multiple opinions help an individual eliminate bad ideas, but it can also help that person weigh the pros and cons of each idea. Although nothing is perfect, with a close examination of each choice, the different ways to go about the decision can be narrowed down to a couple efficient solutions. As Albert Einstein once said, ""You will never know your lives fullest potential unless you consider all sides to every decision."" Asking various people for their input on a decision can help highlight the advantages and disadvantages of making one choice versus another.

Seeing the negatives and positive ultimately leads to making the better choice. If a person asks 20 people for advice, there would be a higher chance of them making the best decision rather than if they only asked two people. A study conducted at the University of Ohio began with two 15 year old boys. Both of them were given the same decision to make, but one of them was allowed to seek advice from others, while the other one wasn't. The decision they had to make was whether schools should incorporate healthier foods into their cafeteria. The first boy, who was allowed to ask others for their opinion, argued that schools should add healthier foods because it creates good eating habits, lowers the amount of unhealthy students, and gives students a chance to make better choices. However, the boy who didn't have the chance to ask for outside opinions stated that schools should not bring in healthier food because it does not taste as good as junk food. After this experiment was done repeatedly with different students, the university concluded that 95% of the time, the student who asked for advice made the better decision. This experiment highlights the advantages of asking for advice from others, since it helps people see the best choice under their circumstances.

Although there is never a clear-cut answer to every problem, asking multiple people for advice can make the right choice a bit more obvious. Listening to others gives different opinions on the matter, weighs the advantages and disadvantages of each opinion, and also bolsters the chance of making the best decision easier to see.

The people surrounding you want to help you, so let them.""",5,1618350000000.0,0,612,"A girl is deciding whether she should take her job offer.

With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadavntage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, ""... Al Gore ---thanks to the quirks of the electoral college---won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidental voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there.                   ",4,1615150000000.0,274,368,Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people. ,Claim,Claim 2,Effective,1615150000000.0,"With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process.

I've heard about the situation on the community service idea. But is it really our choice to choose for other people? Shouldn't the students have a voice on there own opinion wether they do community service. Or even if the whole school does community service. Our school should have a vote on this situation so that our school will come to an understanding. Some of the students believe that the community service wastes there time. While others believe that it is good for our community and will help our country in the long run. Our school will be chaos if we do not solve our problems now. To me I don't think community service would be bad for us. It's not like its going to kill us. But we need to let our school vote on the situation or else there will be people saying that the choice was one sided and was not fair. If we let the kids vote we will not be accused of anything and the decision will be made at the same time. As a student i believe that you will choose what is right after you have read this letter. But really think about this decision you are making. Either way some kids will like you're decision and others will hate it. But you can't run away from the situation you have to make a decision or else it will never end. I know that you are a new principal but you are the new leader of the school. Whatever decision you make certain kids might not like it but they will follow you no matter what. Once an ""Eagle"" always an ""Eagle"". But to me I think we shouldn't be doing community service. That is more of a personal decision a person makes for themselves. And it wont help with our curricular activities. But there can be a compromise to help with this situation. We can start a club for students after school where they can go do any kind of community service. That way everybody's happy and there will no arguments.

I also think that middle school kids shouldn't be handling elementary children. We are not certified and do not have a license. Some of the students might also not know C.P.R.. Which eigth graders are learning C.P.R. and are learning the techniques to help anyone. Knowing C.P.R. can decide wether a child lives or dies. I mean everybody knows that kids in elementary school like to chew on toys and sometimes don't chew there food all the way and they start to choke. The middle school children if they don't know C.P.R. they will be scared and will not know what to do. That's why i feel a middle school child should not be handling a elementary child by themselves. The only way that they should be allowed to do so is that they have the child's parent or an adult they know to help watch the child so nothing goes wrong.

This car would be safer, faster, and more innovative than any other self-driven car on the market right now, providing maximum safety to our people. Driverless cars are necessary to our society for the further development of technology. These new cars are quicker than manual cars, and safer than human-driven vehicles.

Developers believe that once driverless cars hit the streets, there will be a decline in car accidents and crashes. They say that the sensors on the new cars will improve the car and passenger's safety. The sensors can detect information from it's surroundings, and then apply pressure on the brakes for certain wheels, or ease off the engine, which would result in more driving accuracy than there would be with a human-driven car, therefore meaning more safety. Also, Google cofounder Sergey Brin has envisioned a public-transportation system kind of like taxis, but with a driverless car. This can only greatly benefit our society's safety, and our environment, due to the fact that it would use half of the fuel that today's taxis exhaust. There is an outstanding number of car crashes per year due to drunk driving. With driverless cars, people would not have to worry about how they're going to get home safetly, and just take a driverless taxi that they know they can trust. It would also provide a safer alternative than taking the bus, because then people wouldn't have to wait a long time for the bus to come. This would again therefore lower the rate of drunk driving accidents, and other safety issues, once again providing safety to the people.

Overall, driverless cars would be a major benefit to society, and a great advancement for technology.

One person's opinion may not be very good, it would not help the person looking for advice make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinions from different people would benefit the person that needs advice. The benefits would include: making a better decision, helping the person decide, and it would be smarter.

Advice from different people will help someone make a better decision. One person may tell someone bad advice, resulting in a bad decision. It is better to get many opinions from different people; it would help someone figure out the right thing to do. The opinion most people tell you, is most likely the best decision.

Multiple opinions would help someone decide what to do. The person asking for advice may get told one thing by someone, then one thing by another. Asking three or more people would help the person asking for advice; it would help them see which one is the best decision. People would most likely listen to the advice more people tell them.

Asking three or more people would be smarter, people sometimes tend to not make the smartest decisions, therefore, if two or more people tell you the same opinion, it is most likely the smartest decision. Not listening to anyone's opinions will not always be a bad thing, people may know what's good for themselves.

But sometimes people ask multiple people for the same advice. But others tend to just go with their gut and not ask anybody else. Not asking anybody else isn't the worse idea; but isn't the best idea either. But asking other people may be a good idea because there is a slight chance you could potentially ruin your life with the wrong decision. I think that asking multiple people for advice is the best way because you get different views, you can easily conclude what the best decision is, and you could prevent your self form other people getting angry at you for not making the correct decision

First off you would get different point of views. If you don't ask other people's advice then you could be making the wrong decisions and ruining yours or someone else's day. But if you did ask other people then you would most likely be making the correct decision. But if you don't know what decision to make then asking other would people would definitely be the best idea because then you would have other views on the question you asked the person and would get a good reason to do or not to do at the thing you were asking to do. And also if you ask other people for advice then you could be helping your self for the future .

Secondly, you would easily conclude what the best advice is. If you would ask other people for advice it would really easy to identify what the decisions. All the people said the same answer for the advice then it is clear, the answer they gave you is the best one. But if all of them didn't say the same answer, then just go with the decision most people said was the best. And when you still speculate which one is the best decision then just hear the reasons people tell you Which ever reason is the most reasonable than the other is probably the best decision. And which ever decision reasoning doesn't even make sense is probably not the best decision.

And finally, you could really piss someone off if you don't ask other people for advice. Lets say your going out and meeting up with strangers and you need to talk about something to make them your friends. If you don' t ask others for advice and say the wrong thing; not only are they not going to be your friend, but hey will get extremely mad at you for saying that. But if you do ask others for advice about what to talk about then they might be your friend but they might also not get mad at you for saying the wrong thing. And if you don't ask others for their opinions and they do get them mad, you don't know them they could throw a punch or whack you with something and you could get hurt because you didn't ask others for the best advice.

In conclusion, asking others would be the best choice for seeking advice. You never know what could happen when you dont get the best advice and you don't ask others for the best advice. But not asking others also not the worst idea, but asking others is the better one to choose. You would be improving your life from making the correct decision by asking others for the best decision.

Most people find that you can benefit from extra curricular activities. We should all do at least one because participating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships, they can give you something to do, and you can find things you love to do.

Participating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships. I found my best friend in an art class after school, she now lives in Generic_City and we are closer then ever. I didnt want to go at first but once I found her, it was the only place I wanted to be. I am currently in the school play and I've found so many people that share my interests. I have also made so many new friends and now we do stuff outside of school.

Being in an extra curricular activity can also give you something to do. Before I started them all I would do is sit at home alone being bored, now I have something to do. Even when I'm not there I still do stuff for it, and instead of being bored and alone I can talk to people who are also in my extra curricular's.

When you are in an extra curricular activity you can find things you really love to do. Before I was in any extra curricular's I didnt know I could paint, sing or do anything, I thought i was just a normal boring person. When my mom made me join an art class I realized that loved to paint, and when the summer Olympics of 2012 came on I watched the gymnastics portion and realized I wanted to do that, so I took gymnastics. I'm still taking gymnastics right now. I also found out that I loved theater, I joined a play because of my friend and it turns out that it wasn't so difficult after all.

I think that you should help change the way we vote. In my opinion, its complete nonsense that this ""Electoral College"" process is used. If there are citizens who want a good president, and the Congress wants different, it's pretty obvious that the citizens are going to be beyond disappointed that someone different was chosen.

First off, I suggest that some states stop using the ""winner-takes-all"" system. I think that process is outrageous. Do you really think this process is choosing the right person to run our country? Just because the Congress likes this system, doesn't mean we, the people of the United States, preferably enjoy it.

Next, I believe that we should be able to choose our electors, because some people in the government make mistakes. Sometimes people are wrong about other people. Each state only casts one vote, so we better make the best out of it, right?

Also, there is a few reasons why this process is good. One reason why is because if there wasn't this secure system, it would probably be total chaos. Another reason is that this system helps choose which president will do the better for the United States.

Overall I think that this a bad process, and I think they should change this.            ",3,1616080000000.0,0,14,"Dear Senator,

On snow days, kids go out with their friends, play all day, and enjoy their evening with a nice warm mug of hot chocolate with no worries about school. If kids did home school or online school there would no longer be that excitement about snow days and there would be no more snow days. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because they think it benefits the students, but actually it would not benefit students to attend classes at home because they would not get taught anything, kids would not have any friends, and students would not be prepared for the real world.

Students attending class at home would not benefit them at all because they would never get taught anything. When taking online school kids can easily cheat and look up the answers to the questions being asked. This means students are learning how to cheat and care more about making a good grade than learning the topic. If the students are not getting taught the subject that means the students are not learning anything except bad habits, which will not benefit them later on.

If students attend their classes at home then it would not benefit them because they would not have any friends. The students would have no friends because they are at home all day, alone, doing school by themselves. School is about learning and having fun, and if students have no friends, then they are going to miss out on the fun parts of school and end up hating school because they believe it is boring. Another thing that can and will happen if kids have no friends is cause social issues in the future because they are not going to know how to act around other people, since they did school at home.

Schools offering distance learning as an option is not beneficial to students because it is not how the real world is going to be. Some people think that online school is helpful because it is a different style, but they are wrong because it does not teach them what the real world is going to be like. The real world is working with people, asking questions, and working through problems. If kids think that it is normal to isolate themselves from everyone to do mandatory work then they are not going to know how to ask questions when they need help or how to communicate with people when there is a problem. Also, if kids depend on the internet to look up answers to questions they should have learned in school, then they are not going to know what to do in their job.

Schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home is not beneficial at all because kids would not learn any of the material.

This problem is easily fixed if you ask someone or go online and do the same. Seeking multiple opinions on a certain choice is very helpful. Looking for the correct solution can also give you more knowledge and different view point on it, so it can often make the decision a lot easier and way more beneficial, and could even help you make the best decision.

When searching for the correct choice often times advice received gives more knowledge on the choice. An example of this is deciding to get a sweatshirt or not. There are multiple opinions on if it is worth it, one being cost, another being how stylish it is, and maybe one opinion being how comfortable it is. Now with all these opinions the one deciding whether to buy it or not has more knowledge on it, and can make the right choice for them. Without this advice that person could buy it and realize it was not worth for the price or it is not comfortable. Another example is a person's decision of being on a first class in a flight or not. Opinions on this vary which could go anywhere from expense to if it was worth it. After this the person has obtained multiple opinions on this, and they can make their decision based on their need and achieved knowledge. This again goes back to the point that the person may have made the wrong decision for them if they did not ask for more knowledge. The elective someone is choosing could also being an example. The opinions on an elective too vary, like how fun the elective is, how hard it is, and even how useful it is. With all this gathered information the person would choose based on their values and the gained knowledge. Over all without the different opinions different people have some people may find themselves in a bad spot were their decision making was wrong.

During my life this has also helped me out many times, one being on which flavor is should get in a snow cone. Even though this decision will not affect if I succeed or not, it is still a decision that I valued. When asking my friends I got multiple opinions on each flavor. One being that mint was the best since the others had no taste, and without it it would just taste like cold water. Someone else tried to get me to choose the flavor that tasted like sprite. His reasoning for this was that he liked it. Even though both of these both had good reasoning none were for me since I thought it would not be as good as they said. I still took these ideas into account though. Finally one of my friends came up with the brilliant idea of mixing them all together since they were all so different and it was hard to choose. In the end I ended up going with this idea. I still don't regret this decision. The ideas I heard really did help me make a decision and I think it was the correct on.

When asking multiple people you can also get different view point, and not just the facts, which can help make decision based on your values. One thing that does this a lot is when you have a meeting for something. Often times during meeting people are there to solve a problem. There are multiple people there because they want a lot of different opinions to make one choice, because if they make the wrong one it could cost a lot. However, opinions are based on other peoples values so their opinion will not be your. This is not the best but is still gives you input and may even convince you enough to change you choice. Theses multiple view also help if it is a group decision that affect people. Since the group deciding usually wants the best for everyone it would help if the got input from multiple people. For example a farmer would have a different views and opinions than a business man. If they were able to find something that would benefit both it would be a success. All of this could not be as good if they were not able to get multiple view points and opinions. The choice would often times be one that is decided off of someone's personal life. Which would not help other people that are not like them.

Ultimately seeking multiple opinions will help someone make better decisions. So if your struggling with a decision go online or talk to people so you can get more knowledge and view points on your choice, and then you may end up making the perfect decision for you.",5,1617720000000.0,275,340,Looking for the correct solution can also give you more knowledge ,Claim,Claim 1,Adequate,1617670000000.0,Seeking multiple opinions on a certain choice is very helpful.,Position,Virginia,Independent,,Seeking multiple opinions,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet. The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur.

One thing that the article mentions is that the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so.

Another thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion. Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery.

One last thing that the article mentions is negative about the developement of driverless cars is who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect. Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with.

With all these things that could possibly go wrong with these driverless cars there is no way that the developement of them should continue any further. In today's society if something bad COULD happen or something COULD go wrong, it WILL happen, and it WILL go wrong. There are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars.

According to the poll ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election not  the kind we have now."" It is said that ""this year voters are to expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again loose the presidency.""

Under the Electoral College System, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Because of this there are so many questions asked that are answered very broadly due to the fact you do not really know the correct answer. For instace, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding the public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, Sometimes the  State Party's central comittee, and sometimes the presidential canidates themselves.

Man oh man is the Electoral College unfair to voters! This may be an opinion, but it is on of many citizens who are all in agreement of it."" All of the ""winner-takes-all"" systems in each state, canidates do not spend time in each states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" In fact in the 2000 campaing there were seventeen states the did not see the canidates at all and it was said that voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not even get to see a single campaign ad.

Like it says in source 1 paragraph 2 in vaubans streets its completly car free that means that there most be no accidents at all amd less traffic for them. Here in florida we have many vehicles and need them but it would be something different to not have them and maybe have less accidents and help our enviroment too because if u think about it we sometimes leave our cars turned on and that destroys the enviroment that we live in .

first thing if people don't want drive they could just ride bike to work that help them with exerics. Also they don't know that the gas is ever high and they can't affored it and that why they walk or ride the bike.

Another reason is that 27 people had there can impounded or on side of the road becuase  they ran out of gas. when you drive and you see your gas meter and it on the E and your car just stop and you about 2 miles form the gas stion and you have a gas can in the back but you don't want to walk and you know you need that gas so that you can get home you think,think,think and you said i'm walk and you get out the car get the gas can and go. and people don't like drive they can just ride the train to work or the bus becuase you don't really have to put gas in your can you just ride and get drop off were you work.

Next thing i should think that they should make sidewalk for people that want to walk to school,home,work,or freinds house. Well if they family want to go on a trip to see there grandma then they can take there car and go see her. And what ever car you got please look for the limit becuase some car drink gas and then you have to fill it back up again. If it was just less driveing they approach stores,and other thing that they can walk to. If you need a ride home you can call the tax and they will take you home and you really don't have to drive or put gas in the car.

I think people should stop drive becuase you really don't need to drive every day about 4,000 people don't have there license and the drive. if you drive and it cold you should trun a on the heat to low becuase heat will messup your emission. and that why i should think that people should walk stead of drive all the time.

The summer gives students the time to relax and unwind from all the hard work they put into the previous school year. Some schools over the summer want their students to continue their learning by giving them a project. Summer projects should be designed by the students because it gives the students a sense of motivation, students can develop social and creativity skills, and a students extracurricular activities wont be affected.

Firstly, motivation will be developed if students designed their own summer projects. Its proven that most students need motivation in order to do their work. By having students design their own projects they will have the motivation to finish, due to it putting forth their own interests onto the project instead of teachers interests. In addition, it can also explore a students interest in a subject and that can expand their mind in learning and critical thinking. For example, a problem with teachers designing these projects is that students don't care about the material and don't retain the information. This can effect the students grades and lead to a downturn and possibly effect their future grades. A student designed project will help a student retain information better because its on their level of understanding and would create more fun for the student while they are learning the material. Furthermore, during the school year when teachers give projects students rarely turn them in on time. If projects were student designed then students will develop the motivation needed to finish because it is their creative interests rather than their teachers given guidelines.

Secondly, creativity and social skills can be developed if summer projects were student designed. Student projects developed by teachers are normally in a certain subject or area and every student has to follow the given criteria. This can then effect how students communicate and problem solve in school. Creativity is lacking in these students not just because of technology but because the teachers design everything for them. Summer projects should be a time for students to be able to put their creativity to the test. Projects designed by students will take a lot of thinking and they will try many different design to create something which will increase their creativity due to them not following restricted guidelines given by the teacher. Another thing lacking is the social skills a student develops. For example if a history teacher gives students a history project assignment about the Civil War everyone in that class has to do the same thing and no one really talks to each other about it. If students designed the summer projects it enables students to socialize with each other and discuss the different topics that interest them creating a more social environment rather then having a certain view point handed to them.

Lastly, a students extracurricular activities won't be affected if summer projects were student designed. During the summer, families normally take vacations and some students are able to work and even get internships to get experience in different job fields. These students dont have much time on their hands to be able to finish a complicated project. A student going on vacation to Greece with their family doesn't want to stay inside and waste their time doing a complicated project designed by a teacher that they might not even understand. A student designed project can help create a better understanding for the student and they can finish is quicker without it interfering with their family time. In addition, Students with jobs and internships might not have the time to be able to complete a project. These students have schedules and standards they have to follow in order for them to keep their position at their workplace. A complicated project will either interfere with their job and effect their employment or be left unfinished and when the school year comes around their grade will take suffer. But, if the student designed the project then one could actually finish it and enjoy it rather than dread it and not being able to finish it due to their other work commitments.

Some may argue that since the teachers know the material they should design the summer projects. If teachers design it the project will then produce more accurate information for the students knowledge and help them get a good start in the upcoming school year. Though that's a valid reason, The teachers arent the ones who are actually doing the project and learning the new information given. The project might appeal to teachers interests but that won't help the students retain the information if its not something they enjoy or they find the criteria difficult. Whereas a student designed project will help the student because most of them have the same level of understanding the material and students can give each other tricks into memorizing and learning the information. Summer projects shouldn't be designed by teachers because that can effect a students motivation toward the project, it can interfere with a students summer activities, and social and creativity skills won't be developed. The summer shouldn't be a time of stress for students as they have just gone through plenty of it. By developing a system of having students designing the summer project rather than the teachers, can create more possibilities for a students mind and the generations after it.   ",6,1619290000000.0,0,287,Summers in High school are some of the best times in a persons life.

112116,5420623,2099CD327374,train,"Dear Senator,

I believe that people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole were all right in saying the electoral college should be abolished. I have two simple reasons for this. One being that it is not a 100% way to elect a entire nations leader for four years. The other reason being that 60% of people don't even want it.

First off, the process of the elcetoral college isn't always accurate. For example, in 2000, Al Gore ran for office against George W. Bush. During this election, Al Gore won the votes of the people, but lost in electoral votes, giving the presidency to George. Since we all know how his presidency turned out, we wonder how Gore would've handled things. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for, which means if an elector is chosen to vote for Billy Joe, he might just decide, when it becomes time, to vote for Jimmy Washington. This would leave voters of that candidate upset, so maybe they too will understand this flawed system. Another reason we need to abolish the electoral college is something we like to call the disaster factor. This is nothing compared to what happened in 2000; the system allows for much worse. Consider that a states legislature is technically responsible for picking said states electors. Also consider that said elector could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, electors without faith, have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast their vote for whomever they please. Ask yourself Senator, if this were to happen again, would you do what is right and try to dispose of this system? I hope so.

In reference to my second point, do you realize that (According to a Gallup poll) 60% of our people don't even want this system. The way I see it, if i asked three people if I should buy a new car or a used car, and two out of the three say I should buy a used one, I'm not going to go buy a new car despite them. This is the same with the electoral college. We shouldn't be forcing this corrupt way of decididng this nations leader for the next four years, down their throat. This nation is based on beliefs that include the peoples right to have a say in how this nation is goverened. It's so simple, a majority of the people are against the electoral college, so it needs to go. If you, like 60% of the United States agree with my points and views on the electoral college, then you need to do what you can with your authority, to put a stop to it.

All in all, I have strong beliefs, like most Americans, that the electoral college is a corrupt way of giving this great nation to somebody who people think don't deserve it. Based on my emphasis of these two reasons that this failing system needs to go, I think you , Senator, need to put all your power into the downfall of it.

173247,AAAXMP138200002050592810_OR,AFEC37C2D43F,train,"There has been at least one point in everyone's life where you have asked or been asked for advice on a certain topic or subject. Everyone needs help with something, and it is a genetic trait to ask someone else for advice. However, a lot of people can be dishonest, and in this day and age, that number only goes up. Because of this, sometimes, asking just one person is not enough. Now a days, a person looking for help will most likely confront multiple people for advice to prevent problems with misinformation. The problem, while gigantic in scale now, can be rooted down to three different source problems I call ""The Three Probl-Ms of Advice-giving"". These three problems are: mistake, misunderstanding, and misdeed.

While mistakes and misunderstanding might have similar definitions, in this context they are two completely different things. First of all, mistakes are when the advice-giver confuses two similar things and gives the wrong advice. A good example of this is when you are talking about a level on a video game you are having trouble with, and your friend, thinking about a similar level, gives you incorrect advice. Now you are going to have a harder time beating the level because your friend told you about a different level. However, this could have all been avoided if you had asked three or four more people for advice on the level. The more similar iterations people give you, the better the chance that the information your getting is true.

Misunderstandings are harder to avoid because these problems will most likely arise from the environment or conditions you are in. an example of this is you are making a phone call, and the connection is pretty terrible. It is hard to understand what uncle Generic_Name is trying to tell you through all the static. There is really no way to fix the connection nor is there a way to prevent all of the static. The best thing to do in a situation like that is to just get more advice from more people. Uncle Generic_Name is only one person any way.

Finally, misdeeds are when the advice-giver is purposely tampering with information to mess with you. An example of this is when you ask Generic_Name how to play the accordion better. Generic_Name, thinking that it would be funny, tells you that you need to aggressively compress and decompress the accordion repeatedly. you accidentally break the accordion, and Now you have a broken accordion, some damaged pride, and still no idea how to play the accordion. However, this could have all been avoided if you had asked all of the accordion players from your music class for advice on playing the accordion. Also you should not have trusted Generic_Name advice in the first place.

Now, I know what you probably saying ""But what if everyone you ask gives you incorrect advice?"" and to that I say: what are the odds that seven of your close friends do not no what you are talking about? The odds are in your favor; and the on the off chance that the odds are not in you favor? Just expand your focus group, ask new people, be confident. You just need to ask more people.

The use of phones and cars serve many purposes such as communicating with others, playing games, and using the many different internet based features.

We use cars as a means of travel, others to modify and race, and make them look cool. In every day jobs like firefighters and police use cars to patrol neighborhoods and to travel to the location they are called to. For delivery like packages and food we use cars and phones for most of the things we do in modern society. But get in some accidents or cause accidents with cars and we get hurt because of these accidents physically and financially but they can be avoided taking precautions like insurance and driving safe and keep your car maintenance high or good .

The death toll for 2018 is 18,720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018.

While taking online classes their will be things you don't understand but since you dont have the guides you need to problem solve.

Teachers always want to know if you understand the lessons and objectives they are teaching you.

If you're anything like me then you will just act like you know what's going on because you don't want to ask any questions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

If teachers had the Facial Action Coding System device on hand they could easily see how the students are feeling about a particular lesson.

This would work well for the students that don't share their opinions in the classroom or at all.

If students did not understand a lesson the emotion reading device could show the teacher how the students are feeling.

If the device shows students are confused or bored, the teacher could modify the lesson to better the students and increase their knowledge capacity and possibly make it more entertaining.

The technology could also help the teenagers express how they truly feel because some teenagers are hard to read.

Some teens, like myself, have a resting face that makes me look angry at the world and unapproachable.

I think a device like this would show that some peers are not as angry or upset as their resting face shows.

Also, most communication takes place over technology nowadays.

Personally, my school has laptops and I think it would be great if the software was on our devices because emotions play a huge role in everyone's lives.

This software would also help numerous school guidance counselors across the globe because they deal with all sorts of emotions everyday.

I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be exremely helpful.

I believe that the FACS software can be very useful in schools and other places. So here are some reasons that I believe that we should use this new software in our schools.

The new FACS software would be very useful in our schools because, like it states in the artical and by Dr. Huang, the computer could recognize when a child using the computer is starting to get bored. The computer could then change the way it is presenting that particular lesson to make it more interesting and enjoyable. This software could help bring up the overall grades by the student(s) because they now have an interest in learning the subject at hand.

In the artical it shows that this software could recognize the subtle emotions made by the Leonardo da Vinici's painting of Mona Lisa. FACS can recognize the facial expressions made by a child or teenager and recognize the six (happiness, surprise, anger, discust,fear and sadness) basic emotions, just like us people do in our everyday lives. The software can also recognize mixed emotions; FACS has found that the Mona Lisa is displaying 83 percent happiness, 9 percent discust, 6 percent fear, and 2 percent of anger.

Studies have found that when you are sad and fake a smile it can make you just a little bit happier. When moving your facial muscles it not only shows emotions, but also can produce them. When studying a lesson and a child is looking sad' the software could alter the lesson to, lets say, make the child laugh. Everyone knows that laughter is the best medicine. It may not make the child happy over all but it could brighten their day and make the lesson more appealing.

So, in conculsion I feel that the FACS software could be useful in schools and just about anywhere. There are so many things that this software could do to help in our everyday lives, from making lessons more enjoyable, to showing ads that you are interested in. FACS is just overall a good software to help computers figure out emotions and maybe brighten up the day.

I Think that students shouldn't be required to do community service. They should be allowed to choose whether or not they want to. Some students don't have enough time on their schedules to help out , because of sports or other extracurricular activities. A second reason would be because they already help out at home with younger siblings and their parents. Most of the time they barely have enough time to do their homework.

Students should be able to choose for themselves not have someone dictate what they do after or during school. The time it would take to do community service would be depriving students of their education. I don't think we need any uneducated generations to form. Isn't community service for those who have done wrong to the community anyways? Do you want people to think that we have a school filled with convicts, or juvenile delinquents?

I wouldn't want anyone to think that about my school. That is why i believe we shouldn't be required to do community service. We should have freedom to choose what we want to do, just like the constitution says "" life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness""

38308,AAAXMP138200001452852850_OR,A44F6859B4D8,train,"Do you think that we should have school activites? I think we should because it could possible benefit kid in learning. Which means helping kids with better learning that is gong to benefit them by getting up and doing an activity that might help refresh their minds instead of the kid siting in class all day learning about something that might not be instresting to them and they might start to day dream and them not learning anything. I think the school should have activities for students.

firstly, It would benefit a childs learning by refreshing their minds. According to a studies done by Virginia Techs mental studies, states that 74% of students fall asleep or day dream and stop listening and the other 26% of students listen and learn because they are involed in activities that help refresh there minds and givings them time to thing. What this means is that 74% of student stop listening do to being board or just no intrested but the other 26% is in a club or sport that helps that student refresh their mind and helps them think so they are ready for classes and other work that is needed to be done.

secondly, depeneding on the activity it could help build a skill in a student. according to sports news website on collage sports, suggests that 25% of sports players in collage sports that train hard and keep lead to building skills that could help down the road and the other 75% of collage players that dont train hard and just sit around learn how to succed through failer. This means that the collage students that try their best are the one mostly building skills that will help them succed and the other 75% who dont try learn skills through not putting more work into it knowing what they need to try to improve on to become better.

thirdly, trying something new could help find things you might like. according to a studies done at a Virgina univitsy, suggest that 83% of the kid in school that had join club or sports had found a hobby that they enjoy doing and the other 17% of the students that took a club or a sport didn't or could find an intrest in that subject of activities. this mean that students found new hobby that enjoy to do in school when they have tine to do it and the students that didn't find a hobby that they dont enjoy probably dropped out of the club or the sport they were in.

the other point of view, It would be another thing added to a students list and another thing they would have to stress about. According Anderson shores a mental health studies doctor, states that 65% of students that have something else to add to their scedules stresses them do to having a bussy scedule already and the 35% percent of the other students do get stressed out do to not having a bussy scedule or they have good time management. This means that the students that have bussy scedules and cant add this to their scedules so they get stressed and dont know what to do, do to the fact of not being able to find time for it, and the other 35% has time for it so they can add it to their scedules. However this is true but let me tell you why this isnt the case for all students. According to a studies done on time managment, states that 80% of students could manage their time so they could do these activity and the other 20% said the reason they couldn't was do to not properly setting up a good scedule. Basically this means that 80% had the time for it and the other 20% of students couldn't because they didn't set a scedule up properly or just didnt set one up.

To sum it up, there should be activitys it help the student you the reader better learn and buil skill maybe even find a hobby that you like. I think the people that go against this shouldn't but that my opinion, and the reason I think they shouldn't is because it helps benefit learning it help the student refresh so they don't fall alsleep in class o start day dreaming because if they stop listening how are they going to learn. you the reader could do something about this you talk to other students or teachers and get their take on it.

The idea of making kids do community service should have opinions of other people the parents, and the kids and the school staff not just yours.

Some parents have to pick up there kids and other family traditions and or family mater .

Alot of kids do sports and threes a lot of coaches. To taking them out of there sports would not only be unfair but the coaches would not get paid .

The school staff have a life to so having to take care of kids and teenagers after hours would interrupt there personal time or time off of school .

Kids don't like come to school now what makes you think they will want to stay longer after sports or even before sports .

What I am saying is not only do kids already have the right to volunteer and help but its should be there right to choose if they want to or not. Start a club instead of making the whole school do it and garente that the club will get out of school to go clean up the state, county witch ever

I garente you they will stay to get out of class u will have a lot and they will get pride out of doing it !

I strongly support the idea of students having to do community service. If you make it a requirement to have community service it will help future graduates get into a better college of their choice. Occupation opportunity's will be given more to those who have done this helpful deed. Lastly, these students will be known and loved in and by the community for their time and effort.

Students start to think about college when they hit 6th grade. So that's seven years of stress that could be decreased by knowing they have community service to put on their college application. This will get students more aware and ready for their college future . Most colleges need some kind of curricular activity and community service so the best way to get that done with is to have that as a requirement to graduate high school.

After college students will be all on there own. To support themselves they'll need a job. Appling application after application could take these new adults forever to get a job if they didn't have community service to put on those applications. Your choice could effect hundreds of students jobs and how they will live for the rest of their life. For an occupation that pays the way to live needs people who have helped in a community. So lets give these future scholars a chance to make a living.

Our community would be destroyed without the help of those who give up their time to help. Small towns like ours need the small and big things done to keep it a town. The community would be overjoyed with community service by students.

In conclusion without the required community service our students will have problems in their life. With getting accepted into a college of their own choice.

Dear school Principal I do not think that changing the school policy so that students may only participate in sports or other school activities if they have a grade B average is good. I do not like this because our school's star flag football player might have a C grade average but our school has a reputation for a winning football team, so if he can't play on Saturday then we will loose and our reputation will go down. Also i think that we should change the policy to a grade C average because a C is a passing grade and it shows that the student is trying and not slacking. But if the student is getting a D then it shows that the student does not care and therefore should not be allowed to participate in any school activities until the students grade is raised to at least a C grade average. If you change the school policy to a B average then some students will get mad because they can't participate in school activities and there will be many complaints from both parents and students. For example the star football players father or mother might complain about his son with a C grade average not being able to play in the game this Saturday, and therefore he might pull his son out to another school and our school will loose it's reputation and cause many more problems like these. But if you decide not to change the school policy then many students will be happy and there will be no problems and it would be a win win situation and everybody will be happy.

There are many more reasons why it might be a bad idea to change the school policy, like if many students in the school are getting a below B average then if the school has a major event like a Bazaar then many students will not show up and won't be able to fundraise money for the school and the school won't get good publicity. Also maybe there are collage scouts coming to this Saturday's football game and want to watch our winning team and our star player so maybe he could get a scholarship but he won't be able to because he has a C grade average and not a B. If that were to happen and he did play in the game and got a scholarship it would be good publicity for the school.

These are only some of the many reasons why the students here believe that we should not change the school policy to a B grade average, because it would cause too many problems and we might loose good publicity and a good reputation. So we ask please do not change the school policy.

There are many advantages for asking multiple people when seeking for advise. Asking multiple people can help a person make a better choice because it helps him or her understand the better options and different possibilities when solving a problem.

Having better options can help a person make a better choice. For example, high school students can ask their teachers or parent about what college to attend. Their parents and teacher might have different opinions on different colleges. As parents, they might want their children to find a college thats closer to them and teachers might give options that relates to the students' high school courses. The high school student can listen to their advises and better decide which college to attend.

People's minds think differently. If a person ask more than one person with a math problem, they might have different ways to solve the problem.

Which creates the problem that no human being can land on Venus because of its heat and density. Also in the passage, the author states how it's been three decades and we still, despite the technology we have, can't land on Venus. Not even the machine they sent out could survive. Problems like that make NASA more curious, which makes it more worthy of a pursuit.

The author stated that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet. Venus has a roughly 97 percent thick carbon dioxide atmosphere according to the author.

40663,AAAXMP138200001225962850_OR,9B14802F55B8,train,"I agree with this decision because I believe extracurricular activities help young people in many different ways! Extracurricular activities helps us have lower stress levels, learn to be social and work with others, and help us find who we are. Extracurriculars also expand our horizons and give us opportunities and new passions we otherwise wouldn't have known about! Extracurricular activities also make you more well-rounded because then you won't only be in school but you'll also have another responsibility to take care of.

My first reason to why we should have at least one extracurricular is because they help us balance our lives and learn new skills. When school is becoming very stressful, other activities can take your mind off of it and help make you more relaxed. When I am feeling very stressed about something I like to bake things because it takes my mind off all other things I need to worry about! They can also help us with social skills. People aren't always good at working in a group or being a social person. Being able to work in a group is a very useful skill and being on a team can help you learn to be good at that! Some extracurricular activities can teach you valuable things like those.

Volleyball helps me take focus off things that are happening in my life. For example, one day at school I was having a really tough day and I came home super upset and did not want to go to practice but my parents made me. During practice, my teammates expressed how they also had a bad day and talking about it made me feel a little better. Playing that day really took my mind off my awful day because I was so distracted by trying to play well and work my hardest that I forgot all about my day at school!

Another reason why I think we should have extracurricular activities is because they expand our horizons! They help us find new talents we otherwise wouldn't have discovered. You never know if you'll be good at something if you don't try it, and that's what extracurricular activities are for! They can help you showcase your hidden talents and give you new opportunities. Extracurricular activities are also such a fun experience, they can make you so passionate about them if you find the right one for you!

As I mentioned before, I started playing volleyball in fourth grade and since then I've become very invested in it. Before trying volleyball I tried other sports like soccer and gymnastics but I wasn't passionate about any of them. Now I play on a travel team for volleyball and I love the sport so much! It's helped me discover talents I never knew I had before. I never would have known that I can jump high, work well in teams, or give good pep-talks if I hadn't decided to try volleyball!

My last reason for why I think extracurricular activities are helpful is that they make you a more well rounded person. Excelling at school is great, but having another activity really makes you seem more balanced. For example, high school students don't only have school to worry about but also extracurricular activities! If you have more extracurriculars you look balanced and it shows that you dedicate time to work hard in school and in your activity! This helps you develop a habit to work hard in more than one thing which will pay off a lot in the future.

Extracurricular activities such as sports, theater, debate, etc. help so much in trying to get into college. You stand out as a person who can do more than excel at school! Playing volleyball helps me look more well rounded because it's a huge commitment! I have to work so hard to be able to travel every weekend while still doing well in school! It's made me really focus on getting assignments in on time which is really eye opening!

Before I move on to my closing statement, I would like to share about how extracurricular activities help me in my daily life. Volleyball really helped me learn how to balance school and my activities. I learned how to complete my homework days before it's due, how to study for tests quickly and efficiently, and how to catch up on school work after I miss some days for a tournament. My other activities also really help me with stress because I know after a hard day I can go to practice and play my best because of how frustrated I am, or I can bake something tasty and have a nice snack and it really takes my mind off what I'm worrying about!

In conclusion, I think having every student participate in at least one extracurricular is a great decision!

117614,5216985,6CA261D9ABFF,train,"The system by which America elects its president is neither democratic nor fair. It favors small states, could possibly elect the loser of the popular vote, and discourages minority voters.

In many states, the electors who vote for president are not required to vote for who won in the state they represent, says Plumer. An elector could decide, ""I dont like who won, so I'll vote for this other candidate"". One could say, since a party will choose its electors, that it will hardly ever happen, says Posner. It's true, but it shouldn't ever be able to happen, and it has happened. Plumer points out, that several times in America's past, electors have defied the will of the people. It is impossible to be completely sure of someone's loyalty.

Another problem is that it is possible to win enough electoral votes to become president, but not enough of the actual population's vote to have won the popular vote, argues Plumer. Because senatorial seats count towards a state's electoral votes, and the fact that each state gets 2 Senators, no matter their population, more populated states' votes are technically stolen by less populated ones through the Senate. The Electoral College essentiallty has a skewed view of population distribution. Winning a majority of the popular vote in smaller states will give you slightly more electoral votes for population than larger ones. In most cases though, a candidate will win both the electoral and popular vote, says Posner. While that is the case msot of the time, people would not accept the possibility that in, say, a sports game, the loser might randomly win because of the system used to determine it. It is arguably more important that a country is run by the correct person.

Posner claims that the Electoral College prevents a third party jumping in and grabbing enough votes prevent either ""big party"" candidate from winning. While in a truly direct vote, this could happen, the Electoral College allows for the same exact problem. If a third party candidate manages to win the election in just a few states, he could steal enough electoral votes that no candidate manages to get the 270 votes needed for a victory. Plumer warns that ""most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"". A tie, with both candidates getting 269 votes, would be solved in the same way as a third party getting enough votes that no one manages to get over 269. The House of Representatives would vote on the president. Here, the bigger states are again cheated of their power, as the delegates for as states, and not individuals. Wyoming's sole representative has as much sway as the 55 from California. On top of this unfairness, the delegates do not have to vote as the states have. If a majority Republican state were to have a majority Democratic representation, the state could very possibly end up voting in the candidate of the opposite party. As the Electoral College was created at the creation of the nation itself, and the president and vice-president didn't campaign together, the Senate chooses the vice-president, indpependantly. If the Senate and House are are opposite parties, the president and vice-president could end up being from opposite parties. Plumer gives the examples of 1968 and 1976, where ""a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election,"" and ""a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way,"" respectively.

Posner addresses the argument that the Electoral College discourages voters of the opposite party of a state dominated by the other party from voting. He says ""no voter's vote swings a national election... Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politcal preference, rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" That view is what causes people to not vote. Even 1% of America's population would be three million people, and among those three million, there are without a doubt, people who believed that lie that their vote doesn't matter. Plumer's examples of the elections of 1968 and 1976, referenced earlier, are prime examples of times where just about 1% of that 1% of the population's votes were needed to change the possible outcome of the election.

The Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system. The fact that it even has the possibility to essentially make the loser win should be enough of a reason to abolish it in favor of something like a true majority wins election. On top of possible ""failure"", the Electoral College pretends that more people live where they dont, and less people live where they do, and discourages minority voters from even voting, especially if they're in a larger state, an extreme minority, or a combination of the two.

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time.

My suggestions are because, students have freedom when they leave their home and sometime parents need to know the condition their child is in especially if their alone after school or before. Phones should also be permitted on school grounds to the due of, when there's an emergency he/she could contact their legal guardian at any free given time they could. For some students after school have activities and need to bring their cell phone to school if their going to nee it in the after noon to call to be picked up, or what ever the situation is.

Cell phones now days, have trackers to keep up with your child if he/she is in some sort of danger if he/she isn't in school. Also some parents even work late or early and sometimes need to let their child know if they'll be home or not, such as my parents do with me. To myself and others in this school we ask very understandably if you could take a second thought on reconsidering the school cell phone policy. I believe policy 1 is better.

155928,AAAXMP138200002139492810_OR,951B691D3564,train,"School today went by as slow as a snail, but as soon as I took the last step off my bus home, I raced down my street to see the answer I had been waiting for the whole day: If I made it into the Spanish Immersion Specialty center or not. The thrill of the answer made my legs move even faster, so fast that I bolted into the house as quick as lightning, and straight to the kitchen counter where the taunting envelope had been sitting. My family joined me to see what would be revealed inside the envelope as I carefully removed the paper that had been surrounding the letter. ""I got in!"" I happily shouted. All of that worrying was for nothing. But eventually, my brother came up to me, and asked,""You're not actually going to do the Spanish Immersion program, are you?"" I was confused. I didn't realize his opinion on the program was really different from mine. ""Why wouldn't I?"" I responded. ""I don't know, it just seems kind of dumb to me. Also you have to take math in Spanish, and it's already hard enough in English. If I were you I wouldn't do it."" he told me. He began to walk away, as I wondered ""Is this the best thing for me? Maybe he's right. I guess I was all excited just to be in the program that I didn't realize all the challenges I would have to face."" I thought to myself. My Mom made the program seem like a walk in the park, but now by brother is saying it's going to be more difficult than that, which has really changed my opinion about the program. I now think that receiving advice from different people is important because different people are going to have different points of views of the topic, asking only one person might not give me the right advice, and I think the more advice people give me the more strongly I can be sure of a future decision.

First off, I think receiving advice from multiple people is important because everyone is going to have different points of views on the same topic. I would like to start off by saying that no one is the same, therefore receiving as much advice as I can from multiple types of people is going to be more beneficial for my decision than to just hear it from only one person. Plus, their reasoning of why I should or shouldn't say yes to this decision might be not as good as some other reasons I could receive. No one's advice is going to be completely perfect, but it's best to hear from them to see what they think the wise decision would be. Also, no one has the same experiences, so while one person may believe this because of their experiences, another could think the completely opposite because of what they have been through. All I'm saying is many people believe in different things and that is okay because as humans, we are all different from one another.

Secondly, I believe asking more people for advice is the more beneficial thing to do because asking one person may not give me the advice I need. For instance, if I had just asked my mom about the Spanish Immersion program, she would obviously encourage me to go because she doesn't know what it's actually going to be like, but my brother on the other hand, speaks from a regular high school student's perspective and is telling me I shouldn't go. Both of their advice helps me see the pros and cons of the program. If I had only asked one of them, I would only see the pros, or I would only see the cons. Asking one person is a mistake because I will only see their perspective, which their perspective may not be right for someone. They're are many people out in the world who can help out with advice, so don't be afraid to ask!

Lastly, I think it is important to seek out more advice from people because it can help a person be sure of the decision they're going to choose. Making certain choices can be really difficult and confusing at times, but having people there helping me out with this decision is the greatest gift somebody could ask for. Their help with my decision makes me see the different parts of the program, which helps make the best choice for me. Advice is extremely important because it has a big factor in decision making. Hearing about someone's past experiences with a job, or a certain company can really help put a decision in perspective. If I ever need help with another big choice, I'll be making sure to ask for advice again because receiving opinions on a certain subject can really be substantial for a choice.

To sum everything up, seeking out opinions from other people can really influence our choices in a good way. That's why I think receiving advice from different people is important because everyone has different points of view on a topic, asking only one person may not give me the advice I need, and the more advice people give me the more I can be sure of a choice I make. Big decisions can be hard to make. Asking people for thier input on what they think I should do should never be a scary thing to do; in fact, I think being asked for advice in general would make the person being asked feel proud because someone is coming to them for help. In the future, the best way to make a certain choice is to base it around other's advice.                                                                                                                  ",5,1617990000000.0,1474,1542,I now think that receiving advice from different people is important ,Position,Position 1,Effective,,,,Virginia,Independent,,Seeking multiple opinions,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

14460,5156817,E1130AA34EE8,train,"Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered ""car-free"" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to ""Car-free Day"". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicals. The fights against polution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and Bagota, Colombia. And their efforts against polution is really starting to take ahold and become popular.

In Vauban, Germany- The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicals. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the ""experimental new district"". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000$. Just for a parking lot.

Resulting factors from this Car-Free suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicals. Vauban's residents seem to rather enjoy ""the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor."" Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called ""smart planning"". When finished in 2006 57 percent of it's residents sold their vehicals to move into the residence.

Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in low-car/carless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstate/highway.

Even though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New York-ian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950's. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vauban-like.

In Paris, France- Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it's residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with even-numbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31$ in American currency. The same ensued for those with odd-numbered plates the next day.

Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicals for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67% of all vehicals in France.

Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicals the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plug-in cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for odd-numbered plates a few days later.

In Bagota Colombia- Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring car-free day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to car-free day, all violators would be fined 25$. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city.

Despite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to Bagota to see the car-free event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders.

This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990's. Bagota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this car-free day.

Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down polution and smog levels.

The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cash-stapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicals and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.

Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to ""rebrand"" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 16-39 getting a license. Most people are turning to car-pooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.

Many countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against polution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, polution levels. These people/countries are taking the innitiative to take care of the major underlying problems to much bigger problems such as global warming and problems of that nature.

112064,5030159,E00E5656B607,train,"The Electoral Collge is a process where electors vote for President and Vice President, and count the number of electoral votes by Congress. Many people are debating whether or not keep the Electoral College or change it to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Although the Electoral College has been taking place for many years now, it can be a disaster factor. I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it will make the election fair, the chance of there being a tie is much less, and it will be rather rational as oposed to the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is not fair and it is irrational. Voters don't vote directly to the president they want. According to Source 1: ""What is the Electoral College?"" voters actually voting for their candidate's electors. Majority of the states have a ""winner- take- all"" system in which electors are awarded to the winning candidate. Voters don't get to chose who exactly they want, it's based upon which elector they chose that really determines who will win the presidential election. The voters can't always control what the elector they chose does with what thy're decision was on who they wanted to win the election, and they just as well get confused and sometimes possibly make the wrong choice. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is fair for anyone who votes. There is less chance of getting confused and less chance of picking the wrong elector. Even though others may argue that each party selects trusted electors to vote for the patry's nominees, it's still not fair to those who get confused and end up picking the wrong elector which leads to wrong vote towards the presidential election.

The chances of it turning out to be a tie aren't low. Accoring to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral Colleg: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", a tie has happened before. States have sent two states of electors to Congress. Although it happened long ago, it doesn't mean that it won't occur anytime again. Abolishing the Electoral College can give a less chance for that to occur. Since staes have the ""winner- take- all"" system, the candidates don't even spend time or focus on the states that thye know they have no chance in winning in. According to source 2, there were seventeen states who didn't even get to see the election at all, and some votes didn't even get to see the ad of the campaign.

The presidential election will become rational to many people. There may be cons to abolishing the Electoral College but there are more pros to it rather than cons. It would make the presidential election fair and easier for the voters voting for the candidates. People may argue that it's best to keep the Electoral College because some states may not have enough people voting for the candidates so it wouldn't be possible to directly vote for the president of the United States but there are more states who do have the chance to chose and make a direct decision rather than picking an elector who may or may not go agaisnt the party that had picked them and then they can end up chosing who they, the electors want instead of what the voter really wanted and intended. Many people may be able to agree that it is best to abolish the Electoral College instead of keeping it. The electors are picked mostly based upon the state.

Abolishing the Electoral College is the fair, rational, and beneficial thing to do. Keeping the Electoral College won't benefit the presidential election in any way possible. It's better to keep the election fair than otherwise. Voters should be able to know exaclty who they're picking without any confusion or without accidently picking the wrong person. People shouldn't need to be confused about who they're picking and they shouldn't have to posibly worry at the fact that the elector they voted for might defy the will of the voters and they would pick who they, the voters feel like picking rather than picking who the voters vote was actually intended for in the first place. There are risks to basically putting the voters vote in someone elses hands and the voters vote can easily be changed by one of the electors that the party had picked because they trusted that person. If the presidential election was about who you can pick directly, then it would be much easier and the voters will know that the presidential election was fair and nothing was done to change who they voted for in the beginning.                    ",5,1615070000000.0,2556,2817,The presidential election will become rational to many people.

First, the reason why the ""face"" is a natural landform is because on Earth you can compare a face in many objects around you.

The shadows can make it look like it has a nose, eyes, and mouth like structure in cases such as this one.

Although it may be a better environment for students to go to classes and communicate in real life with their teachers and other peers, It would be more beneficial for students to have the choice to attend classes from home through the use of either online courses or video conferencing. Online classes would be a great tool and advantage for those who wants to continue their education because it provides scholars not only to be more efficient and organized, but to also help those who are not comfortable in the environment of a school in general. It is a modern era for both the teacher and the learner, so it is essential for all persons to have the opportunity to continue their education with ease and will.

Without a doubt, it is a necessity for any student to have the skills of efficiency and organization through a means of completing the assignments and work provided to them, for it is what will help them in the near future. Online classes with help because to allows them to take notes or tests in a familiar atmosphere, which will make them more paced and manageable. Being able to do work or assignments at home is favorable because it lets students complete tasks without the need for judgment and pressure a normal, old fashioned institution would emit. Stress is a common factor in terms of learning, for the expectations of a normal school would have any person feeling doubtful and overwhelmed; however, these online classes provide students with the chance to do what they need to do with simplicity and intuition. Some may say that one would not be able to learn well when only looking at a screen; however, video conferencing allows the student to still be at home, but also learning face to face with their teacher or professor. Having all of your courses laid out with clarity through digital aspects shows that it would be easy for any person to become more organized and efficient though navigating these courses with clarity at home and managing your time well in a comfortable setting with efficiency.

Not every person has the same lifestyle as the next, everyone has their own differing personalities and character traits that may or may not clash with others. A comfortable atmosphere for a person seeking to expand their knowledge will be most beneficial because it allows someone who has difficulty in social setting to not feel as if they are being punished for wanting to continue on with schooling. People can be complicated, one may never know what is going on in another's life. Every person is different, no one is the same as the next in any way, shape, or form. Taking classes from home would help eliminate those who are uncomfortable in the environment an everyday school would have, such as those with anti-social tendencies or anxiety. Having so many students in just one building causes many conflicts, whether they be through two students, or between a student and their teacher. Within a school, it is inevitable for there to be an issue depending on how one may react and feel. Although school from home would not completely solve these problems, it would help prevent conflicts such as bullying. Staying at home with the responsibility to complete work should be desirable for any person wishing to pursue their educative life, no person should feel uncomfortable or in dismay when it comes to wanting to learn.

Despite what one may believe when it comes to school, it is essential for anyone to have the opportunity to attend online school from home. Being in the familiarity and comfort of your own home causes beneficial aspects to ones life. It allows them to become more efficient, along with other skills needed to be successful. Prevention of any sort of conflict is important and needed to help whoever is having an issue. Online school is the new frontier, and to many, has already done its justice. Online school should be seen as the next best thing for any person who wishes to pursue their knowledge.

Many people text while driving or call while driving. Snap chat is the most used app by teens while driving, mainly to show off that they are in their new car, or to show that they are out somewhere. Some talk while driving holding the phone up to their ear driving with one hand on the phone and one on the wheel. Others face time still driving with one hand holding the phone to their face and the other one the wheel. Some text while driving with one hand on the phone and the other on the wheel. Others use the hands free were people can just talk into the phone, and tell the phone what to send in text. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

One reason why people should not use cell phones while driving is they could get in a car crash. ""The national safety council reported that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year,"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates). People using their cell phones while driving have one hand on the wheel, and one on the phone causing less control of the wheel. Also some people crash their car due to looking at their phone trying to text, call, or take a picture or video of themselves. Driving and using a cell phone could be dangerous and can lead someone into a car crash.

Another reason why people should not use cell phones while driving is they could get pulled over by the police for the use of texting driving. This will cause the driver to get their license suspended, or lose it. ""Nearly 390,000injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving,"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates). Police try to pull people over before there can be a possibility of an accident happening. People think that police are being too strict when they pull people over for texting and driving, but they just want to help people out before it is no other person in the world to save.

On the other hand, others may go against, and say that Drivers should be able to text and drive. For example if people learn how to text and drive there will be less accidents. In that learning process people can crash the car from being too cautious do to slamming on the breaks trying to stop. Learning how to text and drive is more dangerous than getting stuck at the top of a rollercoaster. Therefore, people should not text a drive ever.

Cell phones should not be at use while driving ever. More people are being killed by it, and others are losing their licenses from it. Texting and driving is not worth losing someone's life, or worth going to jail over. Texting and driving is a big danger and can lead to many bad out comes at the end.

What would happen if you were allowed to use a phone while driving? In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction related accidents, while 421,000 people were injured in the same accidents in America. Texting or talking to someone while driving is illegal for a reason. A text or call is not worth others wellbeing. Phones and other devices should not be used while operating any type of vehicle on the road because it will increase your chances of hurting someone or yourself.

To start, operating a vehicle while using a cellular device can increase your risk of crashing. While people focus on their phones, it's impossible to focus 100% of attention on the road. Due to that, more accidents happen. Insurance will increase if they find out someone has been driving while distracted on their phone. A result of a car crash usually results in someone being hurt. Sometimes people even die from these same car accidents!

Of course, killing someone on accident isn't ideal. Is someone's life or family really worth risking over a text or call? It doesn't take much for a car crash to happen, so if someone is distracted by a phone, it is much more likely to happen. In 2014, cell phone usage caused 24% of car accidents. It may not sound like much, but that is a large percentage of people that were involved in a car accident in 2014. There were 6,064,000 accidents in 2014, and 24% of that is 1,455,360. Using the same source, around 35,000 of those 1,455,360 were deaths. That is not the only thing you are risking, however.

In addition to putting others lives in danger, you are putting yourself at a great risk as well. Those same statistics are not exclusive to the others you affect. It affects you as well. A simple text or phone call could throw you off and quickly end your life. It's just as simple as glancing at a text message. Anything around you at that moment, can harm and potentially kill you.

To conclude, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is illegal for a reason. When someone chooses to text and drive (or call and drive), they are putting a families life at risk, as well as themselves. Even if no one is hurt or dies, there is still the car accident they have to deal with. Cost and insurance will be a nightmare for them. In general, avoid looking at text or answering phone calls while driving. It only takes a split second for an accident to occur.

Since this program cant work on the average PC, Dr. Huang wrote down some simple instructions that encode different emotions. These instrutions are not as advanced as the FACS program but they are simple enough for the average PC. This can dectect your muscular action units to detect all your current emotions. It can also detect fake emotions as if you were trying to fake a smile or frown just by looking at the major mucles on your face.

Dr. huang would like to use this program for kids in schools. He says the program would help detect when a student is becoming confused or bored of a lesson.

70571,AAAOPP13416000023534,14DB88AC2468,train,"The face on Mars can be explained many ways. Some ways may be that it was aliens. Some may say that it is just a unusual natural formation. There is no dought in my mind that it is a natural formation. There are many ways to explain that it is a natural formation.

First, here on earth we have many natural formations that stand out and have plenty of explanation behind it. One of them could be the dunes in the sahara. I am going to compare this to the face on Mars because wind can move sand, dirt, and dust. The wind could have shaped the pace on mars. Erotion could have played a big key in this too. The rock could have eroded from the dirt and sand rubbing against it. Even a metior from a long time ago could have shaped the face. Yes it is odd but if you see in the 19776 photo it is pretty well shaped so it had to be made by aleins around that time. Then look at the 2001 picture and it is eroded and not shaped like the other one. It is just a process planets go through and even earth goes through.

Secondly, the clouds and the camera could have made a little change in the look of it. It most likely is the camera from Viking 1. Nasa even said in paragraph 8 that they couldn't get a clean shot of it through the red clouds. Some may argue that with such an old camera how did Viking 1 get a really nice shot of it. Well that is a good point but it might have occured in that time era because it was in a nice condition to our pictures. Did you ever think though that it is just a rock that probably has alot of sand on it. Look at the 2001 picture, it is in an oval-square like shape. But look at the top of it. It looks like the wind has shaped dunes over the rock. And since the sand has moved it doesn't have the eyes and the perfect shape anymore. Viking 1 had a old type of camera on it. Today we have outstanding cameras and technology and we don't see the face anymore. Which one would you trust, the antique camera hundreds of millions of miles away, or next generation cameras?

Last but not least, it could be a rise in lava or underground material. Mars has the same inner layers as earth so don't you think it could be techtonic plate activity. An earthquake could cause an uprise in crust and rock. In paragraph 12 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It could be a lava dome on Mars; however goes back to techtonic plate activity.

There alot of ifs, ands, or buts in this conversation. I am not saying that there was never life on Mars or there is no life in the universe but us, I am saying that it was most likely caused by natural causes. It could very well be that it was created by water or an ocean.

165857,AAAXMP138200000944452810_OR,34A590772E2D,train,"We have all been in situations were we need advice. Whether it was for school,relationships, or even financially, people always ask more then one person for advice. This is because while asking for advice, seeking for multiple opinions helps you make better decisions. Reasons being their perspective, lifestyle, and experience.

First off, in order to make the best decision when you seek advice. Make sure to have people with different perspectives. Asking people with different perspectives is important since only one or two people will have blind spots in the way they see it. They may be missing a big part of the story with only two people hearing it. That is why it is curtail for their to be many perspectives to hear what you need advice on. Another reason is the different perspectives could be all the advice they may need. Many teenagers get mad when getting yelled at thinking their parents are stupid and do not know what they are talking about. With the different perspectives this grants people to tell the teenagers that their parents love them and the advice they seek is not how to handle their parents, but how they should listen to them. With more perspectives, it also leads to more ways to see a situation. If a teacher yells at her student constantly for no reason, many people may say it may be due to a bias, racism, or even being sexist. When you seek advice the different perspectives grant the student to see that it is not bias, but the teacher is harsher on him because they see more potential in him. This is why when you ask for advice, you need more perspectives.

The second reason you should ask multiple people when seeking advice is the persons lifestyle. When most people buy furniture, the two main factors are appearance and price. When people seek advice on which couch to buy. Most middle to lower class folk would decide on what had the best looks for the most reasonable price. On the other hand, richer cases would not care to much for the price and mainly focus on the looks. This is why when asking for advice, make sure to get it from people that have the same lifestyle. Another reason when seeking advice lifestyle is important is the area you live in. If someone from the north is asking their southern friend if they should buy a Nissan Quest or a pick up truck, the southern friend would obviously say pick up truck. Although for them it makes scene, it would be foolish for you buy that. Thats why when you ask for advice, asking multiple people insures you get people with the same lifestyle. Imagine what would have happened if the northerner would have only asked his southern friend on which car to get. But since he asked many people he got advice from people with the same lifestyles and got him the better car for him. Finally, when seeking advice, make sure to have the same personality or were raised the same as some of the people asked. If someone was at the store and consider buying junk food while on a tight budget, most older children would say to save the money while younger children would please themselves by buying the junk food. An example in school is if a student asked for advice on a class he wants to focus and pay attention in, if he only asked a bad behaved kid, he will tell him to not even care or pay attention. While if he asked his whole class, we would get advice from other students that care too. In order to get the best advice, make sure to ask many people to ensure to get advice from people with the same lifestyle .

The final reason you should ask multiple people when seeking advice is their experience. Although sometimes people feel like they are the only ones stuck and in trouble, many people have been right in the same situation. Many people struggle with money, and asking for advice with an many people with experience is an excellent way to solve that. You need to ask people with experience, not just one close friend. Another example of this is if you were hurt by a friend or partner. Although many people keep to themselves when this happens, asking for advice from many people with experience could help since they were in the same situation at one point. They may also have a safer approach to your issue. For example, if someones girlfriend cheated on them, they might want to egg her home and throw toilet paper in her yard. Well, they decide to ask for advice from many people and someone with experience said not to. They said to relax and think about why she did this instead of acting out in anger. So they decided to settle down and reflect on how they can improve their self character. Finally, experience helps while asking for advice since they usually have a better understanding of your issue. So back to the example of being cheated on, he thought he was worthless and it was his fault. But since he asked for advice from multiple people, based on peoples experience it showed them that she was toxic and used him. The experience reassured him and made for a healthy break up. Getting advice from multiple people and gathering their experience is key to getting the best outcome possible.

When seeking advice, having multiple opinions helps you make better decisions. Reasons include their perspective, lifestyle, and experience. These are the main key factors needed while seeking advice from different people. From now on, when you seek for advice, make sure you ask at least five different people and include different perspectives, same lifestyles, and experience. ",5,1618110000000.0,3509,3599,"

Some students would agree with the principal. Some students would disagree with the principal. It's the same way with the parents. Here are three good aspects of having to participate, and my opinion. I agree because students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find a new hobby.

My first reason as to why I agree, is because students can get more exercise. Students get a good amount of exercise in gym. However, some students don't get any other exercise. Plus, it is always good to get more exercise. Students need to maintain a healthy body, because a healthy body is a healthy mind. Getting exercise releaves stress for some students. some are lazy couch potatoes, and need to get off their butts.

My second reason as to why I agree, is so students can make new friends. Some students don't have a lot of friends. A student without friends is like a puppy left out in the rain. However, forcing them to participate in an extracurricular activity can change that. Some students like making friends, but don't know how to make friends. Some students have a lot of friends, but want more. If there is a new kid, it would give them the chance to make some friends and meet new people. Therefore, doing this can change a students life.

My third reason is so students can find a new hobby. On the one hand, some students have plenty of hobbies. On the other hand, some students don't have any hobbies. However, most students have one to five hobbies, which is a fair amount. For the ones that don't think they have enough hobbies, this a great way to help. Also, this could help some students figure out what they want their profession to be.

In conclusion, I agree that principals should force students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find themselves a new hobby. Students don't get nearly enough exercise in gym class. It's always good for everyone to make new friends. Also, you can never have to many hobbies. Doing this is good for everybody, even the staff. The staff members that participate will be working more hours, therefore, they would be getting paid even more money. If you think I'm right and made some good points, then show this to someone that can make this a thing in schools near you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ",4,1616000000000.0,399,405,ecause ,Unannotated,Unannotated 1,,,,,Virginia,Independent,,Mandatory extracurricular activities,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

165855,AAAXMP138200000944452810_OR,34A590772E2D,train,"We have all been in situations were we need advice. Whether it was for school,relationships, or even financially, people always ask more then one person for advice. This is because while asking for advice, seeking for multiple opinions helps you make better decisions. Reasons being their perspective, lifestyle, and experience.

First off, in order to make the best decision when you seek advice. Make sure to have people with different perspectives. Asking people with different perspectives is important since only one or two people will have blind spots in the way they see it. They may be missing a big part of the story with only two people hearing it. That is why it is curtail for their to be many perspectives to hear what you need advice on. Another reason is the different perspectives could be all the advice they may need. Many teenagers get mad when getting yelled at thinking their parents are stupid and do not know what they are talking about. With the different perspectives this grants people to tell the teenagers that their parents love them and the advice they seek is not how to handle their parents, but how they should listen to them. With more perspectives, it also leads to more ways to see a situation. If a teacher yells at her student constantly for no reason, many people may say it may be due to a bias, racism, or even being sexist. When you seek advice the different perspectives grant the student to see that it is not bias, but the teacher is harsher on him because they see more potential in him. This is why when you ask for advice, you need more perspectives.

The second reason you should ask multiple people when seeking advice is the persons lifestyle. When most people buy furniture, the two main factors are appearance and price. When people seek advice on which couch to buy. Most middle to lower class folk would decide on what had the best looks for the most reasonable price. On the other hand, richer cases would not care to much for the price and mainly focus on the looks. This is why when asking for advice, make sure to get it from people that have the same lifestyle. Another reason when seeking advice lifestyle is important is the area you live in. If someone from the north is asking their southern friend if they should buy a Nissan Quest or a pick up truck, the southern friend would obviously say pick up truck. Although for them it makes scene, it would be foolish for you buy that. Thats why when you ask for advice, asking multiple people insures you get people with the same lifestyle. Imagine what would have happened if the northerner would have only asked his southern friend on which car to get. But since he asked many people he got advice from people with the same lifestyles and got him the better car for him. Finally, when seeking advice, make sure to have the same personality or were raised the same as some of the people asked. If someone was at the store and consider buying junk food while on a tight budget, most older children would say to save the money while younger children would please themselves by buying the junk food. An example in school is if a student asked for advice on a class he wants to focus and pay attention in, if he only asked a bad behaved kid, he will tell him to not even care or pay attention. While if he asked his whole class, we would get advice from other students that care too.

I think it is a great idea to help the community, because there are some people that don't even care about the earth as much some other people. also i think that when you are eating lunch you should clean up around yourself. also when you don't have anything to do you should help pick up things and you can throw it where it should be thrown in and that is the trash. After you do what you are supposed to do you can do that every day and that is how you will help our community. Also when you have helped you should go to other places and if you see trash on the floor pick it up even if its not your's. Another thing is when people throw things on the floor tell them to pick it up and if they don t pick it up for them. and also you can help the community by telling your friends and maybe they would help you clean up litter and that way you wont be the only one helping you can be the first person to start and also you can feel really good that you aren't only helping yourself you are helping others. and there will be a large amount of people helping the community.

I don't think that kids should be required to perform community service. It should be volunteer work that kids can enjoy. I only think that kids that get into a lot of trouble should be required to perform community service. If kids are required to perform community service it might take time away to do other extra curricular activities, such as music, sports, etc.

I do believe that helping the community is very important. It helps make the world a better place. Whether it's tutoring students or helping clean up the environment, it's a very big part in helping the world one step at a time.

Some kids like to do community service while others don't. I think that if the kids would like to perform community service then they should. Someone who doesn't want to, shouldn't have to. Kids who don't like to do community service sometimes wind up doing anything they can to get out of it and nothing gets accomplished. If there was a way to inspire kids who don't want to do community service, then that would be a perfect thing to do. If they're inspired to do that then they will enjoy it and keep doing it. Tutoring elementary kids is a very good example of community service. It helps kids become more intelligent. If your tutoring in sciences or social studies, for example, you can help kids become inspired to perform community service. I think it would be great if all the kids helped out in the community somehow, but I still think that they shouldn't be forced to do it. It's not really fun to do something when you're forced to do it. It would be better if the kids that help out actually enjoyed doing it.

Cleaning up litter is another good example of community service. It helps the world stay clean. If it stays clean, people might realize how clean it is, and they might stop littering. Some other examples of community service include; cleaning up graffiti, helping at a retirement home, help clean at a restaurant, rake an elders leaves, shovel someone's sidewalk, etc. There are many choices and most kids like different things. There's a big variety and I think if kids knew what there was to choose from then they might change their mind about helping out.

Another reason why I think community service is important is not only because it helps the environment, but because it can encourage some kids to get out and experience new things and ideas, instead of sitting around all day at home playing video games or watching television. I myself have a habit of doing that, but I help out sometimes. I'll go to my dads work sometimes and help out with the elderly, or I'll help my neighbor kids with their work that they don't understand, or I'll go shovel somebody's walk. Community service can be really fun and I think that kids just need to realize that there's a whole bunch of choices with helping out in the community. That's the position I stand in.

When people for ask advice they're looking for ways to help them decide or do something that their not sure what they decided on what's the best way to go. Advice is a lot of opinions , options , and ideas , all of those things can bring you to the best decision you can make but it could also be the worse decision of your life depending on who you listen to the most because not all advice is good. Which is why you should focus on what your asking advice for and from who are you asking advice to.

The good thing about asking advice is that it will give you the best opportunity to make the right decision. Its best to ask people who are close to you and know what kinda person you are. Family would probably the best choice because they grew up with you , know how you are, and know what's best for you .But If you don't have a family then you can ask a friend but make sure that your friend will not turn against you because if that happens the advice they give you can be a bad thing. If you don't knwo if your friend is a good person to ask from well you can compare the answer they give you from the one that your family gave you because friends are like family if your friend is truly your friend they will have kinda the same advice like your family did or even better. If you do that you will know that the answer your getting it's not just something random or unhelpful instead that its a good option to choose from.

Some people may think asking multiple people can be way too much pressure, and turn out to be a bad thing which sometimes can be true but you can always learn from those mistakes .

It will be a lot of pressure to have a lot of different opinions from different people but isn't having to make a decision alone and not having but one or two options to choose from already pressuring enough .

Maybe having more options will take some pressure off or it might add on to it but not everything is gonna be easy as pie .

I think getting advice from multiple people and some of them being bad advice will be a great thing because then you will see the difference between good and bad .

No one will ever learn anything by getting a few opinions from people and thinking there getting a better chance to get a good outcome out of that because is not all about them their decisions affects others too .

Thats why not only you have to think about yourself when asking for advice but also ask people who you know will be affected by the choice you make .

I have experience this before and let me tell you i wish someone said all of this to me back then. I had to make a decision between my boyfriend and my best friend. When me and my boyfriend started dating my best friend kept complaining that i hanged out more with him than her and that we barely see each other anymore, which was true. One day she told me i had to chose between them of who i wanted to be with because she wasn't gonna be waiting around for me to act like a friend. I thought it was dumb and she was way out of line but i had a few days to figure everything out. Of course i couldn't decide on my own so the only person i asked was one my other friends because she knew both my best friend and boyfriend. She told me if i was happy with my boyfriend that if my best friend is really my friend she should understand that and deal with it . I thought that made sense so thats what i told my best friend and she said ""i understand your happy with him but what is what i don't understand is why you have to be with him all the time, but i guess you made your decision"". Then she left before giving me a chance to say anything. I went home and started crying , my mom asked what was wrong and i told her everything that happened. She gave me some advice to what i should do and should've done and i started thinking that if i just would have asked my mom or anyone else for advice I wouldn't have lost my best friend. If that happened to me imagine of what other people been through or lost to just because they didnt ask other people for advice and didnt think they had many options.

In conclusion, seeking for advice to multiple people and get multiple opinions is the best choice you can make to make more better choices and not affect other people in a bad way. but doing that will not always turn out of be a good thing and it'll be okay because you still have the rest of your life to make up for it and get better at it .

In order of you to get a good outcome out of that will be to make sure your asking the right kind of people like family, close friends, teachers ,any adult you can trust. Also be sure to ask the best amount of people because having more than one option is always for the best. If you try to decide something hard by yourself and end up decide wrong it will not just effect your life but also the people around you and maybe some people you dont even know.

Maybe you dont want to ask because you dont want to involve other people to it but for all you know they can already be involve so why not risk it. If the decision your asking advice for needs to or you want it to be a secret and asking one or none for advice will keep it that way thats just selfish because every secrets are gonna get out in some point and if your decision will affect other people then it shouldn't be kept secret. Some people dont ask for help because they think it makes you look weak even if some people see it that way its not it will be stressful and a lot pressure but nothing in life is simple and you'll never know if having multiple opinions from people will make you feel relive and it will give you the best opportunity to make the better choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",4,1618260000000.0,0,131,I believe asking for advice to multiple people is the best way to help you see all the options you have and do what's best for you. ,Position,Position 1,Effective,,,,Virginia,Independent,,Seeking multiple opinions,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment.

Often times crashes are the result of distracted driving. This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones"").

Many states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time.

In sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.

For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Do you agree or disagree with this decision? Use specific details and examples to convince others to support your decision.

Students should absolutely not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. There are many reasons why a program like this will never work. Students that can choose if they want to participate in clubs will most likely be able to manage their time more efficiently. Students might not be fit to join these clubs or be able to participate due to their lack of experience in the subject. Most of the students will not be in support of this new program and will be upset by it. These are a few more reasons that this requirement will be a bad decision for the school.

Students that do not want to participate in these activities probably have a very strict schedule or are not interested. Students should not have to choose which activity they take outside of school that they must stop for an extracurricular activity that may not interest them. Many of them have probably given their commitment to other activities or sports teams. Some of them might have signed contracts with instructors for these activities.

Extracurricular activities take lots of time and must have full commitment. Students that are not interested in giving time to these activities, but are forced to participate will negatively impact these clubs. These clubs will be spending their time trying to influence a student that may not want to be present. Lots of the extracurricular clubs might not have enough space for people to join or participate in. These clubs will want students that are loyal to them and provide effort. Many of the students that join extracurricular clubs will most likely use the space they are provided to work on unrelated assignments and not participate.

Many students will want to join a sports team. These teams will need to have more tryouts and the tough decision of sorting who is a better fit for their roster. This requirement could be good for promoting physical activity, but still would not work due to the amount of players, and the lack of available positions on sports teams. This requirement would not be performed very well with the current population of students in extracurricular activities. Students would not feel obliged to participate and would have to be forced to participate.

The last, and best reason that students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities, is their ability to choose. Students should be able to choose what they would like to do with their time after school as long as it is appropriate. Most students use their time wisely and participate in programs they desire. Other students perform very well in classes and do not take part in other activities. This program would be taking away from student's time. Requiring the participation in extracurricular activities is not an ideal decision and will negatively impact many people. ",4,1615670000000.0,823,912,"hese are a few more reasons that this requirement will be a bad decision for the school.

Being in the comfort of my own home would definitely make me want to learn more. Most of the time I do not want to deal with the people at school and it even stresses me out. That stress interferes with my learning abilities; therefore, learning at home would be the best choice for me. Although many people say distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferences is not beneficial, in reality learning from home is more beneficial because you are in the comfort of your own home, there are no distractions, and if you are absent, it is easier to get caught up.

There are many different factors on why learning from home is beneficial, for example, being in the comfort of your own home. I know many students who accumulate stress when interacting with people at school and would rather learn from home where they are most comfortable. Most of the time when I am at school, many different things stress me out. For example, I hardly ever raise my hand to answer a question because I have that fear of what if I get it wrong , then the whole class will laugh. If I was at home, where I am the most comfortable, I would not have that problem and there would not be other students that can judge me.

Another benefit by learning from home is that there are no distractions. There are probably hundred of distractions in a classroom, not even including the thousand distractions throughout the whole school. The distractions that distract me at school include: other students talking, someone making a funny noise and the whole class being off task, and now I even fear of a school shooter. A method that helps me is going into a smaller class for my Study Hall. I go into a smaller classroom, called Math Lab, to work on my math homework and ask questions. Sometimes I do not have math homework, but I still go because the smaller, more quiet environment is beneficial when getting work done. Math Lab is like my home and it benefits me because of the one on one helping and the little to no distractions in the room. When thinking about all these distractions puts a stop on your learning; however, when you are at home there are definitely less distractions and you feel safe.

Lastly, if you are absent a lot of the time, it is easier to get caught up and you do not have to worry about being behind. I know that in high school probably 75% of students are student athletes. This includes them going out of town to play their sport and them having to miss a couple days of school. That has been my life for the past 12 years because of my competitive cheer I do outside of school. When you are a competitive cheerleader you are required to compete at all the competitions, including the ones out of state. When I go out of state for a competition, I always have to miss at least two days of school. In high school there is not one day you do not learn something new, so missing two days is a big deal and puts me behind. By learning online I would not have that problem because when I am out of state I can still learn from the hotel and never be behind on learning.

Others might say learning from home is not beneficial because physical human interaction with different teachers and students help a child learn more. That is not the case because in high school you strictly only learn. You walk into the classroom to sit down and not talk for 90 minutes. You hardly ever interact with the students around you because you are forced to learn. If you were learning from home that is exactly how it would be, but better because of the beneficial factors. The only difference is that there is a one centimeter screen between the teacher and student.

Would you rather be comfortable when learning with no distractions, stress, and fears? Well that is how learning from home by way of online or video conference would be like. Different factors from being at school pours into your learning abilities. You first start out your day with the struggle to wake up and leave the house because you are dreading to go to school. Then, when you get to school you have to sit in a hard, plastic chair for 90 minutes, while being distracted by your fellow classmates. Already half way through class you have the fear of missing an important part of the lesson because of all the distractions. Now, you have built up stress and there is no way of learning when you constantly have stress. Imagine having stress seven hours a day, five times a week for the nine months you are in school. Are you even comprehending anything you have learned throughout the school year then? Therefore, learning from home is the best route to go and will save many students from over thinking and accumulating stress. ",6,1622060000000.0,2408,3173,"I know that in high school probably 75% of students are student athletes.

While giving examples he asks questions for you to think about while reading the rest of the passage.

The author supports his idea that exploring venus is a challenge by stating that no person who has landed there has lasted more than a few hours. Which is proving why it is a challenge because it is dangerous . Although it is the closest planet from earth the passage states that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". Venus is 800 degrees Fahrenheit and a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. That can kill you at any moment because you can burn to death and you are breathing in bad air.

The author states that ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"".

The author is saying that yes earth is dangerous and that we could die here but going to venus is a bigger risk and could kill everyone that went. But, if we only send two or three people up they could see how dangerous it is . If they survive they would be able to tell us what equitment we would need to go back up there and study safely.

""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" The author is stating that scientist are putting peoples lifes in danger and are not finding diffrent way to study this planet. The author also states that ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" The author is simply asking if they will try and come up with a safer way to study venus than just keep sending people up who obviously are not going to make it.

NASA has been studying different and safer way to study Venus. It may be able to help scientist study Venus a safe way and not kill multiple people. In the passage it states ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""

I think that we should not change the way we vote we should keep the Electoral College. Maybe instead of changing everything we should keep what we have. Most likely everthing will be a total disaster. If we change everything it will all fall under the pressure. We really dont need change in the world today as it is. It will be hard to get up after this big of a fall.

Well what is bad about the Electoral College is that it is unfair for the voters that is doing the voting. Because it is all about the system of winners taking all. Some candidates dont spend time in the states. If they really know that they do not have the chance of winning. They say that this stuff is outdated and irrational. They are thinking of abolishing the Electoral College instead of keeping it.

But on the other hand what is good about it is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism. It is a non-democratic method of selecting a president. But it is not a democratic in a modern sense. But it is good because the people vote for a trusted slate of electors. But the trusted electors vote for the party`s nominee. Even though the Electoral College has a lack of most everything.

Everyone has that one good argument. Everyone calls the Electoral College a disaster factor. It says that the people in America should consider themselves lucky. Well because in the year 2000 a election called fiasco was one of the biggest election crisis in the century. The legislature`s are technically responsible for picking the electors. Well also the electors can defy the will of the people.

Also this thing can be argued. Well about changing and also maybe keeping the Electoral College. Because there is some pro`s and con`s to this situation. There is going to be up`s and down`s when it comes to this topic. There might be many more to come in the near future. This topic is one topic that everyone is arguing about this day in time.

This is evident as in recent years there has been a big problem in our society with drivers using their cell phones while driving. It has gotten so bad that it has become illegal because driving while using a cell phone is more likely to be the cause of a fatal accident, than when a person drives under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Use a hands free device at all times while driving. I say this because a cell phone will take your attention off of the task at hand. A driver's focus should be maintained on only driving to ensure safety. It has been proven that driving while using a cell phone is the cause of more vehicular accidents resulting in a fatality than those caused by drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

In two thousand and thirteen there were three thousand one hundred fifty-four people killed in distracted driver related crashes. In just one year's time, there are three hundred and ninety thousand people injured in accidents caused by texting and driving. I personally do not use my cell phone when I drive, because it distracts me very easily. I suggest that drivers should be able to use their cell phone for an emergency purpose only. Even in a crisis situation, the driver should pull over to the side of the road before making a call.

I also encourage that the cell phone companies should be made to have the cell phone come from the factory to where if your cellphone is moving, it will not be allowed to ring or give you any notifications. In order to get your notifications, you will have to manually tell your cellphone to read that you are not driving for it to allow you to open the phone. It will then give you the notifications and or missed calls you have missed. In addition, it will not allow you to access absolutely any of your social media platforms or let you get social media notifications while you are driving.

In conclusion, my opinion on whether drivers should be using their cell phones while driving is that they should refrain from using their cell phone while driving. This is because driving is a task that requires a lot of focus and a cell phone is very distracting.

1. like me many students do after school activities such as sports or academic UIL activities and these require many hours of long hard work well after practice for theses events is over you need a ride over and since the majority of the student body doesn't have cars we need a way to contact our parents so if we weren't allowed to bring our cell phones to school we would have to use a school telephone and that could take a long time. For example in our coaches office their is one phone that allow us to us so imagine if 45 kids trying using that one phone it would really be a hassle. Plus most kids that have cell phone don't even get them out during the day so what it hurt allowing us to have our cell phones.

Some people believe students should attend class from home while other people believe students would not have benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Firstly, students can improve their teamwork skill to work as a group with other student. School have group work or the project that students can join together and work as a work. To illustrated, when the teacher give work to students that is a group work, and students should have a partner to work together, students have to talk to each other to plan what they need to do and help other understand what to do. Students can learn how to work with other person. The teachers must have group works for their students. Student should have teamwork skill because it will help them in the future when they have jobs to work will other person. Thus, for improve teamwork skill of students, they should attend classes in school that they can work as a group.

Secondly, Students can make friends in school. Students can relax and enjoy to attend classes when they with their friends. For example, after students finished their group work, they also have a good relationship with their partner. When students have friends, their can teach each other to understand to the classes and help to do their homework or class work. Students can make a lot of friends and help each other to pass the classes that maybe hard or easy for them. Therefore, to make friends is not hard to do when students are in school and school have many classes for help students to learn.

However, not everyone agree with this statement that some people believe students would benefit from being ale to attend classes from home because students can work and learn with their own way, have classes that they very want to learn, and help them to work in the computer. Nevertheless, look overs as an important point that student can ask questions to the teachers when they are not understand. When their friends can not help and do not know what to do students can ask the teacher for help. For example, When students do not understand in the class, and they can ask the teacher to explain or speak slowly for them to have more understand. The teachers also have to help their students to pass the classes, so teachers ready for students to ask them any questions. At home, students can not ask to the teachers if they are offline or no internet, and then they will ask their parents, but not all questions parents can answer.

104840,AAAOPP13416000123199,6F5B58C28A2D,train,"A world full of driverless cars seems a thousand years away; the thought of being able go anywhere at anytime without driving or a driver seems to be science fiction. However, with recent advancements in the field of driverless automoblies, this fantasy can exist sooner than one might think. With the Google Car program and BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" the world of driverless cars may almost be here. I believe that development and research for the creation of truly automatic transportation should be continued, based on information from ""Driverless Cars Are Coming:"" the invention of driverless cars, the safety implications and solutions, and the options for making driving a better experience.

Completely driverless cars continue to be science fiction, but with advancements in technology, the dream of driverless cars is within reach. But the obstacles of driverless cars are not as simple as just inventing one. Right now, driverless cars exist, such as Google's modified Toyota Prius. With a multitude of different sensors, including a rotating radar on the roof, this car can mimic the skill of a human. These developments have revolutionized the field of driverless cars; with the Google Car project, it is possible to have a driverless car today. But there is still room for improvement, such as safety and the driving experience, which is why development of these driverless cars should continue.

The issue of the safety of automoblies is still relevant to driverless cars as well. If there is a situation that the driverless car cannot handle, there could be accidents and damage. However, driverless car developers continue to address this problem, and solutions have been proposed. BMW has announced that they have developed a car that can drive itself for speed up to 25 mph. They also require that the driver keep attention to the wheel, and will notify if there is a situation where the driver must take over. This allows the driver to navigate work zones or around accidents, increasing the safety of the driverless car. The car can alert the driver in several ways, so the driver can always know when it is necessary to drive. With more development, the cars can be better prepared to handle situations and know when to notify the driver, increasing the safety of the experience.

With the invention of the driverless car, the driving experience can change in new ways. The aspect of driving a driverless car allows the driving fun to be interpreted in diferent ways. This especcially proves true for in-car entertainment options. With cars that can notifty the driver whenever there is a situation to take over, the driver can relax and use in-car entertainment and information systems safely. These increase the driving experience and what the driver or passangers can do, without endangering people or property. As more development is made, the driving experience can change to make driving better for all; a time to relax or have fun, while maintaining safety.

With so many advancements in driverless cars, a world run by driverless cars is a possibility.

143918,AAAUUP138180000069582125_OR,80D2FE30F665,train,"Offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing by schools is a good idea, but I take a position on this issue to say that, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes classes from home due to the following reasons.

First of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.

Another reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesn't get any understanding, or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year.

Lastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.

From these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.

Smart cars are cars that help you with your driving skills by telling you how close you are to something behind you, or even by stopping your car before you crash. Now, the big issue is creating driverless cars. This idea is extremely terrific and can cause a breakthrough in modern technology.

With driverless cars, no one needs to worry about buying any cars anymore. Sergey Brian thinks that ""driverless cars [can] form a public-transport taxi system."" This taxi-system will be able to take people to and fro wherever they like. Also, these cars will most likely only use up half of the fuel that regular taxis take.

Driverless cars will be more efficient than humans because of their faster response to driving situations. This is possile by sensors that ""can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine."" Many sensors will have to be placed on the car to provide the safest driving possible. Google has put many sensors on their modified version of a Prius, such as on the wheel, roof, rearview mirror, and even a 3-D camera ontop of the roof. All of these sensors help to mimic the actual driving skills of a human, but better.

Some people may argue that the driverless cars are not safe because they still need some help from the passenger for emercency situations. They are wrong because humans can manage to stay alert while the driverless car is still driving. The car can manage to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.""

This is only because the car has not been programmed to handle crashes, or roadside dangers yet. However, manufacturers are making new ""in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" These will help keep the driver alert at all times and enjoy their ride.

In more ways than one, the development of driverless cars will be a huge success in modern technology. Having a driverless car can make human lives easier, prevent most crashes, and cause a safe trip on the road. With their highly-alert sensor systems, and their fast-acting brakes the driverless cars will make sure that you get to where you are going fast, safe, and easy.",4,1621540000000.0,287,417,"Now, the big issue is creating driverless cars.

There have been incidents where the majority of the popular vote from U.S. citizens did not lead to the election of that candidate. This is because of the electoral college. This is the cause of citizens not having the president they asked for. Most American people do not agree with the electoral college. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses are wrong, Bradford Plumer).

The disaster factor is a what the electoral college should really be concerned about. The system allows for many slip-ups. ""The American people should conside themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century"" (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses are wrong, Bradford Plumer). In 1960, segregationists in the Loisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Also, electors who aren't loyal to the county have occasionally chosen to vote for the party that they'd want rather then vote for their party's candidate. Popular vote is what our founding fathers wanted in the beginning. They wanted equality between people, and the wanted the people to vote for who they wanted as a leader. With the electoral college, this vision cannot become reality.

The popular vote is what a Democracy is all about. ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachorism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense"" (In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to Keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President, Richard A.

Most people will ask advice from their friends or peers, but there is a chance that their answers may be incorrect. There could be many situations where you feel that it is neccessary to ask for advice. For this reason, whenever you are in a difficult situation, it would be best to ask multiple people for their opinion. But be careful to ask the right people because they might have different opinions that will not be beneficial for you. Young people especially should follow the advice that they think would be most helpful for them because they probably do not have much experience. Asking for multiple advice or opinions can be beneficial by narrowing down the bias in responses, help you make better choices, and it may guide you through your struggles.

A reason why you should be careful with asking the right person for their opinion is because it is likely that they will include bias in their response. For example, when you ask for someone's opinion on which pet you should own, they will more than likely tell you which pet they would like to own instead because they have more knowledge on that particular pet. However, that does not mean that the pet they reccomend would be best for you. Instead, gaining more knowledge about each pet by asking for multiple advice can lead to making better choices. Although some may include bias in their response, their opinions still matter. There is no right or wrong answer when you ask for opinions because you are really asking for their thoughts. In fact, their advice may help guide you through a difficult path that you will have struggles with.

If you think about a difficult moment in your life, was anybody there for you, or helped you get through? Sometimes guidance can be what we need. All the advice that people give you can really be helpful at times where you don't know what to do because they can help you choose a better path that you should follow in order to be successful. For example, a difficult moment in your life could be a time where you got sick, and this could be the result of not following your parent's advice to dress warm when you are going outside. At such times when you don't follow advice, the results could lead to something you don't want. If you think you're better on your own, you could be left clueless of what you should do in different situations. Your mind would be blank and anyway, the next thing you would probably do is turn to a friend or a family member for advice. Your family and friends give you reccomendations because they care about you and wish the best for you.

Choices are hard to make sometimes, especially when it's between two things you love. It wouldn't be the best to ask others to make choices for you since the results will affect you, not them. However, asking for soemone's thoughts about a specific topic would be beneficial because they can help you out step by step. Even if you don't realize it, choices affect you in some way or another. Making the right choice can be harder than you think, so you have to be careful and think through all the possibilities. If you make a choice that you are not sure of or that you don't trust, the results can have a big impact on you and your future. For this reason, it would be best to ask people who have some experience on the choices you are about to make. This goes especially for young people because their brains are still developing, so they might not know what is best for them. Asking someone with no experience may not be able to give you the best advice. Knowledge is key when it comes to making choices and even getting the smallest advice, can have a large impact.

In conclusion, recieving advice from multiple people is better than asking from only one person or nobody. Everybody has had times in their life where they did not know how to react or respond to a specific situation. These are the times where you would feel that it is neccessary to turn over to other people for ideas. But sometimes, people who recieve advice are not grateful for it. People who care about you want the best for you, so they give you their opinions and advice so that you can be successful. Advice and knowledge can guide you through in almost any situation. Do not ignore opinions and be thankful for the advice people give you because they might affect your future.                                                                                                                                                                             ",5,1618260000000.0,3228,3467,"If you make a choice that you are not sure of or that you don't trust, the results can have a big impact on you and your future.

Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers.

We ask for advise to get through rough times, bad situations, and even life itself. Three main reasons why we ask for advise is because we all have fights in friendships,get into bad relationships,and struggle in school.

First of all, we all have our fights with friends over periods of time. They can happen because both of you could like the same handsome and popular boy in school. Fights with your friends can even happen with liitle things like a disagreement and start to fight over that. It happens it's part of life. Another example is you not going to their birthday party last year and you both stop talking to each other. Make it up to her this year and try to plan to go to that brand new amusment or water park that just opened a few days ago.

Secondly, girls could get into bad relationships and not know what to do. To all of the girls out there we all get into bad relationships. I can tell you I have had many of them in my life. We all fall for that cute,pretty, and sinister smile on their face. I have seen it so many times it's unreal to belive that once we say yes we fall into their plan to take our hearts and just tear them to shreds. Boys can be like that. They plan to trap us and never let us go to see the bright beam of love again. Until you meet another one who is more caring and loving and you start to feel that sensation you used to feel and you know you found the right one.

Finally, we all struggle in school. It's like you try and it's not enough to power through the year you are there. I have been there so many times that I can't count. I struggled in math so much I wasn't passing in that class. It was so hard for me to where I had melt downs and called me stupid and dumb.

They tell me that i'm not stupid and dumb and to just keep trying and to push on and to always look ahead and never look back.

This letter is concerning your idea of a school policy of no sports or other activities unless you have a grade average of a B or higher. My view on this possible policy change is that it shouldn't happen. Many students have a C average and their only outlet is sports. Without being able to participate in sports they are going to turn to other things, and it's not going to be homework.

Sports play a vital role in student's lives whether they have an A average, a B average, or a C average. Grades are very important but so are sports. Kids my fellow students still need to be active no matter what. Without sports to do kids who are having problems at home or problems with their grades use sports as an outlet. It is something they can enjoy doing and helps them feel better. Why would you want to take that away from them?

Without sports students are going to start turning to something else. Drugs. Without sports as their outlet they need a new one and they are going to start hanging around the wrong kids. They are going to start slowly killing themselves from the use of cigarettes and other drugs. Do you want that happening?

You are the one who is always saying ""Stay active"" ""Don't do drugs"". By enforcing this new policy you are basically encouraging the opposite of those phrases. The kids who have a C average aren't going to be able to do sports and will find drugs as another outlet. So instead of trying to make things better by encouraging people to get their grades up so that they can do sports, your creating the opposite effect and making things much worse.

I strongly advise that you do not go forward with this policy because it is going to backfire very badly. I don't know about you but i do not want our school to be known as the drug school who doesn't support everyone getting active. That's not the title that SCHOOL_NAME deserves, but it will be if you enforce this new policy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME

Many say that they were tense when they owned a car, but once they got rid of it, they claimed to be more happy. That last statement has to be coming from a liar because why would you ever be happy without a car?

In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Many sociologists belive it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment since transportation is the second largest source of americas emisions just behind power plants. programs are suggesting that people use other methods of tranportation. which is cool, i guess?  Different things are suggesting that we are converging and witnessing a long term cultural shift.

I hate essays, they are obnixious and boring. this is all a huge waste of time and i wish i just stayed home like some of the other kids in this class so that i wouldnt have to take this. Cars can be a nice way of driving around in money bags and showing everyone that you can afford this unnessacarily large vehicle that will sit in the hot room connected to your house, that also has a tempature very similar to hell.

You are beyond excited because you finally get to drive without your parents. There is something so exciting about being behind the wheel because you are the only one in control. Being able to drive your own car car feels awesome. Driverless cars do not get you that same feeling as if you were in complete control. I am against the development of driverless cars, because the driver isn't in control, technology screws up, and who's to blame in the scene of an accident?

There is something so satisfying about being able to drive your own car. Knowing you are in complete control can be a little scary.

Being the person in control can make you more responsible and aware of your surroundings. Driverless cars are not like that, even though they can alert you when there is complicated traffic, you could still doze off or be in the middle of watching a movie. When Google can make cars completely driverless what is the point of ""keeping your eyes on the road"" if the car is already doing that for you.

Technolgy today is very impressive and has come a long way, but still isn't as perfect as the human senses. If you are ""driving"" down the road in a driverless car and you fall asleep. All of a sudden the car crashes because dirt flew into one of the sensors. If you were actually driving the car you would have been able to avoid this situation and been aware of the surroundings. There will always be glitches in technolgy and something could always go wrong.

In case of an accident who is to blame, the company or the person in the car?

Well it is a driverless car, right?, so the driver should be able to do things that normaly can't be done when driving. The company of the driverless car might say it was the drivers fault becasue they were asleep or texting. In general there will be conflict between who's fault it was. In reality if it was a normal car it would have been the driver's fault.

Driverless cars wouldn't be able to give you the thrill of being behind the wheel, technolgy is not perfect, and in the event of an accident who is to blame.

I think that allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off or on silent during class time is a great idea because use kids be in school for a long time and sometimes we do get bored and off task but if we had our cell phone to living it up it would be much better as long as we can still come to class and get our work done.

But i also may think that its a bad idea because if more kids are being allowed to bring their cell phones to school that might cause more bullying and problems like phones getting lost, stole, broken and possibly taking when in class because students mite for get to turn it on silent or off before classes.

It also may be a very good idea because some penents don't allow their kids to take their cell phone to school because it is not allowed with in the building but if the children are allowed to use the phone with in some periods of the day.

Even though cell phones where not around for a long time it has been a key factor in us daily life to which it as reaches a point where people are now using cell phone even while driving. People use their cell phone for a lot of reason and important things, things such as calling, texting, emailing and more, these activities while driving increases the driver's risk of causing an accident. doing this not only put the driver at risk but also people and other drivers around in that area. Despite the danger that cell phone causes some people argued that it is necessary to use cell phone for emergency reason. However, there are proof to show that cell phone should not be use while operating a motor vehicle.

Texting is a very serious issue and people should take it very seriously.

we become so interested in what we are doing on the phone and forget that were still on the road driving while on your phone increase the chance 25 times more likely to cause a crash these bad decision that we made while driving always end up in death are serious injuries.

Not paying attention, and the hazards we face while driving is something we learn to avoid before getting our driver license. knowing the dangers, it might cost people still use cell phone while driving. People who work depend on cell phone like businessman, lawyers, etc. says that they all ways need to be accessible to their phone in order to keep business going and to secure client. Because of this selfishness, they put other people life's in danger. Research on google shows using of cell phone while driving is responsible for more deaths on the road. in these days we all are multitasking and it is difficult to put the phone down especially if you're on the road for a long period of time. However, it does not worth the cost of your life are someone else's.

Thousands of people die every year in transportation that resolve from cell phone use according to the national highway traffic safety security agency. 81 present of us resident admit to using cell phone while driving on the road. Driving while on your phone is dangerous because it causes distraction and crashes. it required three main types of distraction such as, visual, manual, and cognitive. 'Visual' distraction is the most common distraction, this is when drivers focus and eyes are taking off the road. this is when a person now starts to pay attention on their phone and not on the road while driving. the second distraction is 'manual', this is when driers take both hands off the wheel for reason like adjusting their GPS eating and drinking etc. the third distraction is 'cognitive', this is when drivers mind isn't focusing on driving this could be cause by talking to another person while driving, are having family issues etc.

drivers should consider the consequence of driver and being on their phone and make better choices for their self and others. If people don't stop using phones on the road the number of accidents will only increase more.

137352,AAAXMP138200001953332125_OR,302578B02AF9,train,"When placed in school, many students discover early on that learning in a public setting works best for them. Having the option to work in groups and chat with friends can help certain students astronomically because they thrive off of human interaction. however, this is not the case for everyone. Most students actually happen to perform worse on their assignments when attending class at school. Because of this, more students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home instead because working at home minimizes distractions, helps students with deadlines, and allows a student to learn how to teach themselves material that they will later use in life.

It is a known fact that, if given the opportunity, most people would chose to partner up with a friend to work on an assignment. Working with peers, especially in school, may seem like a good idea at a first glance, but studies show that when surrounded by all of their friends a majority of students tend to get less work done. If a student were to switch to online classes at home, this would not occur. When students work alone they are able to actually stay focused on the tasks at hand. Self working students do not have to deal with the distractions of talkative friends and also won't feel obligated to engage in their friends' conversations because they will be by themselves. There are also other factors in a school setting that distract from a students leaning that doesn't happen at home like the temperature of a classroom, or the white noise of air conditioning. Both of these things can make the leaning experience uncomfortable for students because the environment around them is not ideal. If the a student was to attend online classes then the problems of loud background noises and inconsistent temperature wouldn't factor in negatively toward some students' performance on school work because they are in the comfort of their home.

Additionally, Student that attend classes from home are better at meeting deadlines. When doing online assignments there are usually due by dates that show when the student needs to turn in work. Although in school teachers also require work to be turned in by a specific time, teachers tend to continuously extend a students' work period. Teachers are also more likely to extend dates of quizzes or exams for their students. If teachers are always pushing back dates for assignments to be turned in, then a student will never fully learn how to meet a deadline when they are out of school and get a real job. An online course would not provide this feature. When students attend online school, all of their given assignments have to be due on a specific date that will not change. Although it can be stressful at times, this concept helps students in the long run because it allows them to learn how to adjust their time schedule to be able to get their work done on time in order to meet the deadline.

Furthermore, when students take classes at school, it is more likely for them to get a teacher that does not teach well enough. There has been many cases in multiple schools where students are failing classes solely because their teacher wasn't the right fit for them. Students who complete assignments at home, on the other hand, do not face this problem at all. When students are given a task that that they have to learn, it is more likely that those students will succeed in the lessons they taught themselves because they are able to use a method that works best for them instead of having to adhere to someone else's way of teaching. Students that are in the habit of teaching themselves school work will also figure out how to successfully learn other life skills on their own like cooking or learning a language. Being able to learn different skills by themselves is more beneficial because it allows people to rely on themselves instead of always going to others for help and possibly getting the wrong information.

Most people would argue that students do perform better when working in a social environment. Some believe that it provides students with more opportunities to better their social skills. However, it is more beneficial for students to attend online classes at home because it minimizes distractions, helps students meet deadlines, and it allows students to get in the habit of learning life skills to help them in the future.                  ",6,1621550000000.0,3053,3950,"There has been many cases in multiple schools where students are failing classes solely because their teacher wasn't the right fit for them.

First, the planet Venus it toohot for human life to survive. Venus is the second plantes from the sun it's too close to the sun for us to even try to make it there. Also no one knows how long it will take us to get to Venus wonder if the spacecraft run's out of oxygen. If it run's out of oxygen everyone will die before theyy make it to Venus, but wonder if they do make it to Venus it might not be a lot of oxygen to breathe in because the planet is so hot. Then wonder if there no water you need water to survive ecause Earth is a liquid based planet,but Venus is not.

Secondly, how do we no if the spacecraft will be able to take that type of heat. The palnet surface temperatures on Venus average over 800 degrees fahrenheit I know that's way too hot. That type of temperature is beyond of what I can imagine I know Earth's surface is hot, but not that hot. Venus atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide I think it's like that, because it's so close the sun. The closer you get to the sun the more radiant energy it gives off and too much radiant energy can be bad. Like how do we know that the spacecraft will still be getting singnal from Earth, because wonder if the eletronic gadgets over heat and just give out because the planet is so hot.

Lastly, they say that venus is our twin planet. I don't see how it can be our twin planet because it so hot and it's very radiant. The planet Venus has a rocky sediment and icludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Earth and Venus can be twins because Earth is not rocky it's a liquid based planet. Venus has a thin atmosphere because the heat keeps it's so hot and thin it can't get a break to even expand. But Earthis not as close, so Earth's atmosphere is a little bit thicker the Venus's atmosphere. Venus might also have some harmful chemicals.

106104,5198113,15B1E4516018,train,"Dear state senator,

I personally believe that we should stick to and continue the idea of the Electoral College. For one, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted to vote for the right candidate. Secondly, there isn't much that can go wrong in the Electoral College. Last but not least, by electing a president of the United States through popular vote, the right person may not be elected to be president for our country.

To start off, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted by the parties to make the right vote for president. The Electoral College is a system that was created by the founding fathers created in the Constitution. When voters go off to the polls most have the thought in their mind that they are voting for their next president when they really are not. In the Electoral College there are 538 electors, which ever candidate gets the majority of 270 electoral votes wins the election. In source 3, the passage states ""When you vote for a presidentisl candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"". The electors that are in the Electoral College are selected by a certain party and the party trust that the person will vote for that certain party's candidate. With this process, the candidate that ends up getting elected is more likely the right candidate for the president spot.

Secondly, when using the Electoral College there ins't too many things that can go wrong. Most people that choose to go against the Electoral College would say that ""with the Electoral College its not really our choice when we vote because in the end the electors from the party vote for the president"". In source 2, the passage states ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" If a tie with the electoral votes is to ever take place, the House of Representatives would handle the election and state delegations would have the final vote for president. Also, if a tie does take place then the Senate would vote for the vice-president.

Last but not least, if we switch to the popular vote election process then the right president candidate may not always be elected. This point can go against both sides. The side that supports the Electoral College may say ""the people may vote for a certain candidate because of his color or race"". The side that supports the popular vote system may say ""when we go out to vote it doesn't count towards anything because of the electors in the Electoral College. So why are we even going out to the polls to vote?"" Also, with the Electoral College there will not be any run-off elections. In source 3, the passage states ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"".

In conclusion, I believe we should keep the Electoral College system going so we can have a more fluent election process. For one, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that the parties trust to make the right vote. Secondly, when using the Electoral College there isn't too many things that can go wrong with the election process. Last but not least, if we switch to the popular vote election process them the right president candidate may not always be elected.

The Face on Mars is real because it can be a natural landform on Mars just like we have natural landforms on Earth. Now may I ask a question? How can ailens make a face on Mars? In the picture provided, it seems the face pops out and there is no evidence that a creature could have made a face with no flaws. In the article, a webiste states "" thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.""

I understand that people may have a theory about the face, but hence the word theory. Theory is just a guess with evidence supporting the claim, but is there enough evidence to support the Face? People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape.

How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face. The face could have been on Mars since Mars was created and NASA just never payed enough attention until 1976. I do not believe an ailen created the Face on mars.

Is the face on Mars real? Keep that question in your head. I believe this essay has provided enough evidence proving the Fac on Mars is just a natural landform. That's just my opinion.

It's impossible because we spent a lot of time and money reaserching if humans can go live on Mars.

10713,5027654,404EB0C0E899,train,"There are a few reasons why it's good to not drive your car. One, is that your car emits so many greenhouse gases. And greenhouse gases are baad for the enviroment. Two, is that it promotes the use of bicycles and/or public transportation. Three, you really don't need your car anyways. Those are the reasons why I say that it would be good to limit car usage.

My first reason why I say we should limit car use is because of the greenhouse gases we are releasing into the air. In article, ""In German Suburd, Life Goes On Without Cars"", paragraph 5, it says, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates."", which means that 50 percent of the greenhousse gases that we release comes from cars.

My second reason why we should limit car us is because if we use cars, we would use something else to get around like a bicycle. And if we use a bicycle we wouldn't be releasing any greenhouse gases.""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bycicle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor."" stated in article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". This is prety much encouraging us to use bicycles instead of cars.

We only use our cars to get us from place to place, stated article, ""The End of Car Culture"", paragraph 40 which says ""A car just a means of getting from A to B when BART deosn't work.""

The average person uses their phone many times a day whether it be consciously or not, we as a people always have access to our own devices. The problem with people using their phone is when to use it and how to use it properly. When inside of a vehicle there should only be a bare minimum of use to your phone. Whether that reason would be an emergency call or even doing simple things like using the maps application. All in all, humans as a whole should be able to use their phones but only to an extent.

The use of a phone in a car could be proven to be fatal but there are good reasons to use said phone, only in certain situations. One of the reasons would be that to use your phone to get your way through areas you have no idea how to get through or using your phone to find your way home from a place you have no knowledge on. The downside is that when the person glances at the phone to see where to turn or make a specific move they lose the focus on the road for a split second which could be fatal. Sometimes the use of a phone all depends on what kind of person it is.

The person themselves also plays a big role in the use of cellphones in the car. The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses. The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone.

Phones play a big role in people's lives and it even saves them sometimes but the use of a phone is dangerous when the person is distracted on their phone. A second could save them from a life threatening accident. The amount of people that are in car accidents that involve phones is 26% in 2014. When the person is using their phone they are putting themselves and other people at risk on the road. According to the National Safety Council, the use of cell phones when driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually.

Texting while driving would be the biggest issue when it comes down to the use of a cell phone. According to the NHTSA, driving while texting is six times more dangerous than driving drunk. Also texting while driving is now the lead cause of teen deaths in the USA, more than 3000 teens die each year alone as a result of sending a test message to somebody while they are in the use of a car. The amount of consequences for just the use of a phone is just not enough, is the phone as important as the person's life? It should never come down to that question because your life is way more valuable than sending a text to someone while driving.

68071,AAAOPP13416000050467,ABB7625615F2,train,"The ""Face On Mars"" is getting talked about a lot lately. Many people have different opinions about the face. If you aren't familiar with the ""face on mars"" then you're probably wondering why there is an argument going around. You're probably wondering this exact question: ""Why is there a big argument about ""The Face On Mars?"" The folllowing details and information will be informing you exactly why scientists and theorists are having different opinions about the peculiar face.

Some scientists are saying that the face up on the moon was not created by aliens because of all the research they have done with and about it. One example that tells you why it isnt an alien artifact is the shadows. The only way the messa (face on the moon) was able to have facial features was because of the shadows that was cascading down upon it. The shadows gave an illusion of eyes, a nose, and also a mouth.

Another example, would be the pictures that the scientists have taken. The first picture that was taken was taken on a cloudy day. The picture was to blurry to be able to make out any details. In 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took another picture that was ten times sharper than the first. One of the cameras they had contributed greatly to the search, since that camera was so sharp they would have easily been able to find any markings from extraterrestrial beings.

Also another detail helping the scientists was the weather. The weather took a massive part in this study. Since it wasn't a clear day at all and there were ""wispy clouds"", like in paragragh eight, the MOC team could not get a clear picture. When the team comes back to take yet another picture it is a clear day and with that clear day they are able to pick out any details from the ""artifact"" if there are any to pick out.

A final example, is how they compared the face to a formation on Earth. The scientists compared the face to the Snake River Plain of Idaho because of how similar they are. They are similar in a way because of the isolated messa, height, and landforms.

Theorists are saying the exact oppsoite from the researchers. Here is an example fo why they thought it was a true artifact. A few scientists themselves thought that is wasn't just a landform but something more. Since the scientists believed many people instantly believed too. They didn't think about the research that was done, but they chose to believe the few scientists.

An example that would support the idea of them believing, is that there were many movies made about the face. Many people believe everything they hear and what they see on T.V.

A final example is, how the skeptics thought it was created. ""If the aliens didn't create it then how did it form?"" That question was most likely going through their mind, trying to figure out if they should believe science and research or they should believe movies and others.

Yes, i understand how skeptics actually believe that the face was made by aliens because they dont know how it was created. They don't know who created it either. Scientists are proving that it was weather that created the formation and maybe even astroides. Theorists may also thinking that the haze prevented the scientists from seeing the alien's markings. If weather and haze prevented that then why didn't the scienists see the markings on the next photo that they took. That photo was even ten times shaprer.

The examples I have lsited help inform you why there is an argument going on about the face. Science clears and explains a lot more phenonmon than opinions and belifes do.

This can greatly help someone who cannot decide on something and needs others advice on the situation.

One reason people ask multiple people for advice is because people can learn from others experiences. People can learn from their mistakes and can share information about what to do and what not to do to others going through a similar situation. For example, my mom is one of the first people I ask if I need advice on anything. She is much older than me so I assume she has already experienced most of the things I go through. A few months ago, I needed advice on a school project so I went to her for help. She told me about similar projects she did at my age and was able to give me some advice on what to say and how to present the project. Since she had already experienced a project similar to the one I had due, she was able to give me solid, good advice on it. Another reason to ask multiple people for advice on something is because there is more information to use.

Everyone experiences things in different ways. This allows a variety of information to use when trying to solve a problem. For example, when I first began babysitting children in my neighborhood I was nervous because I was scared that I would have no idea what to do. I asked my mom, my dad, my aunt, and my friends for advice. Each of them had very different advice and opinions on what to do with the kids, what to feed the kids, and how strict I should be. I gathered all of the feedback and was able to come up with an idea of how I should act around the kids and what to do with them. Using the information that other people had gathered from their own babysitting experiences allowed me to be prepared for mine. Yes, asking more than one person for advice provides more information, but it also gives a clearer perspective of the situation.

Hearing other peoples views on a certain topic or problem can provide a clearer view of the situation to the person actually going through it, giving them a clearer idea on what to do about it. If someone does not completely understand the situation they are facing, hearing someone explain it to them or give their views on the problem can help the person better understand it. For example, a few years ago in history class, we were learning about World War 2 and I didn't understand why some people did what they did and how they thought it was a good idea. I was very confused with most of it until my friend and teacher explained it to me. They told me about why certain sides did the things they did and what some of it represented to each country, religion, and side. I soon understood what it was all about and how it affected us and the rest of the world. Another reason to ask multiple people for advice on something is because it can help people who are very indecisive get a quicker and sometimes better answer.

In conclusion, it is sometimes helpful to get more than one persons advice before making a final decision because it can provide you with more information on the subject, allows you to know what other people have done in the same or a similar situation, and can give you a clearer view on the problem itself. ",5,1617740000000.0,1139,1261,Everyone experiences things in different ways.

The multiple opinion can make better choice by thinking what you didn't thought before. And we can consider advantage and disadvantage based on their experience,knowledge,and environment.

People can decide the view of the opinion based on person's experience and person who asked a question will have opportunity to consider about all opinion to make better choice. Each person has different experience. And they use their experience to decide the best choice. For example if person wants to do bungi jump and ask people whether to do or not. And if the person whose answering this question had tried bungi jump and felt that it's fun,that person will say it was fun so do it. But if the person whose answering this question saw the news about accident while bungi jumping,that person will say it's dangerous so don't do it.

People has different opinion based on their knowledge and the person who asked the question,will have opportunity to consider about the safest choice. Each person has different knowledge. And and based on the their knowledge,people decide whether the opinion is appropriate or not. For example if the person went to mountain and found the mushrooms. And he or she was very hungry,he or she asked to people whether to eat or not. And if the person whose answering the question don't know about the mushrooms,will say you can eat it. And if the person whose answering this question knows well about mushroom cause he was interested about it,will say they might be poisonous so don't eat it.

People consider different things based on their environment and the person who asked the question,will have opportunity to decide which is the best choice.

Many people debate on whether these projects should be designed by teachers or students. It's a parent dream for their kids to still learn over the summer, so some send them to learning activities or ask teachers for school work for their children to do while on vacation. But do these kids really learn anything by these projects or school work if their not enjoying it? These summer projects should be designed by the students because not only will they be learning but they will also be enjoying doing these projects, students can also use their creativity to design these projects, and also because these student will be doing these projects over their summer vacation they should at least be able to design their own project.

If a student isn't enjoying how they are learning it's most likely that he or she will not pay attention and actually not learn anything. It's the same case with these summer projects, if students are able to design their own projects maybe they'll learn more than they usually do and enjoy doing their project. For example, teachers sometimes do projects in their class that they design, they choose groups,and they choose the topic for the group. The students of course their going to do the project but they wouldn't learn anything about it because their going to do it just to get the good grade. However, if the student design their own summer projects their grade will most likely increase because they didn't only do the project to get a good grade they would do it because they would enjoy doing the projects they designed.

People always say they want this generation to use their creativity more, especially in school teachers always tell their students, ""Use your creativity!"", but by teachers designing the summer projects, they limit the creativity many students have. How can students use their creativity if teachers will not even let students create their own summer projects? Designing their own summer projects will let students use, show, and express their creativity and who knows their projects can get positive feedback from other students. Students using their creativity in designing these summer can influence other classes in doing the same. This could help many students in using their creativity not only in projects like these but also in all their school work.

If students have to take time out of their summer vacation to do these projects they should at least be the one designing their own projects. Many students do not like doing anything school related over the summer; therefore knowing that they have to do a project over the summer it is most likely that lots of students wouldn't do the project. Especially because teachers do the same type of projects most of the time. But knowing that they can design their own projects and use their creativity its likely they'll do it. Summer vacation is the one vacation every student loves they should at least be able to enjoy designing their project as well.

Doing a summer project wouldn't be fun if it's the same project we get while we're in school; but by letting students design their summer project maybe, just maybe they could enjoy it. It would require them to use their creativity which lots of students like doing, show their creativity. Summer vaction is the longest break we have before going back to school, students should at least be allowed to design a project they want to do. Students like doing new things and constantly doing the same thing all the time. To conclude, students hate doing school work over the summer because all they want to do is enjoy their vacation and relax; but designing their own summer project could be fun for them.          ",5,1619110000000.0,647,710,students can also use their creativity to design these projects ,Claim,Claim 2,Adequate,,,,Virginia,Independent,,Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

42900,AAAXMP138200000649202850_OR,10B5AC99E165,train,"After-school activities offer a variety of things, and students often choose to stay after school to enjoy them. However, being forced to stay past school hours to participate wouldn't be much fun for something that's supposed to be an activity to enjoy in your free time. Students should not have to participate in after-school activities, because some students may have other matters they need to attend to (family, jobs, etc), may already be doing a time-consuming activity outside of school, or may not have transportation home.

Students may already have things to do that take up after-school time: for example, they could be needed to babysit younger siblings, to take care of another family member, to do household chores, or to work an after-school job. Requiring students to do an after-school activity would take up this time, where they might be really needed.

Having students participate in things beside schoolwork is important, but not more important than family or work needs. They might be leaving a younger child alone, just because they have to participate in a sport or student council. There are things more important than extracurricular activities.

Students may also have an outside-of-school activity to participate in at the time. Many students choose to take lessons or sports outside of school. For example, they might have private instrument lessons, a neighborhood science club, or a sport team that isn't school-involved. These activities are just as important as school ones, and they shouldn't be forced to miss them because of requiring extracurricular clubs. The outside-of-school activities are often paid for, or require money in some way. This would lead to a loss of money for the parents, paying for lessons that the students can't attend. Students may lead busy lives, and they shouldn't have to have them taken up by even more school-required things.

Another reason school clubs shouldnt be enforced is that while buses and parent pick-up are often available at the end of the school day, it is not always the same when it's already been an hour after school. Parents also often have busy schedules, and they can't always be available to drive their student home. That is one reason why some students choose not to participate in extracurricular activities. But if students are being forced to stay after school, they might not have a ride home. This would create a problem, because then most of the school would need a bus ride home, and that would require a lot of buses and bus drivers. This would be very financially taxing for the school, so it would be better to just let students go home at the end of the school day. They have already been required to attend school for seven hours; it would not be fair to make them stay longer for something that isn't even education-related.

In summary, students have busy lives already, taken up by chores, family commitments, possible after-school jobs, schoolwork, and outside-of-school activities. They shouldn't be forced to add more things to their schedule. Extracurricular activities are meant to something fun and enjoyable in a student's free time, a choice to partake in something they find interesting. Making students attend extracurricular activities would take the fun out of it - it's supposed to a chance students can take, not another thing forced upon them. These students have lives to live, things to take care of, other time-consuming responsibilities in life that are more important than school-related ones.

132740,2021000934,DF944DD9C026,train,"Dear Principal:

The ability to have cell phones on school campus is not the best idea. Kids can cheat on tests without the teachers knowing. Sometimes teachers trust the students that they wont text in class, but kids can break that rule. Yes, sometimes it is nice to have your cell phone out for a calculator (if you are allowed to use one) or even to call your parents if there is a big emergency happening at the school, but kids ruin the advantage that they get for being able to have their cell phones out.

Since I a' m a student at a SCHOOL_NAME, i think it will be awesome to be able to have your phones out during break times. The only thing wrong with that is kids will have their cell phones on in classes and text when they are not supposed to. If i was sitting next to a student that texts non stop during class time, it would be very annoying. So not only is it rude for students to text while their teacher is speaking, but also can be disturbing to students around the person that's texts while they are trying to do class work.

If you can only have your phones out during break time and not during class session that wont be a hard problem for some student to listen to. Some students will listen to that rule and teachers can trust them; but there are still students out there that will text during times that they are not allowed to.

In conclusion, students should not be allowed to have their cell phones on school grounds. If they were allowed to have their phones, then they would text during classes which is rude to the teacher; and they also won't learn anything if they were texting.

Eventhough cars are a really fast way to get from one place to another there are many other ways for example a train,air plane or boat. There are too many cars on the streets and many crazy drivers. People should stop using cars because cars make greenhouse gas and it's causing the air to be polited. Another advantage for limiting car use is that less people are going to be geting killed because of car axcidents or because of drunck drivers. Also if people stoped driving cars aand tok there bike to work or were ever they go more people would be in shape becuase they would be doing some excersice too.

Too many cars on the steets are poluting the air and thats not good for us because we are cutting down trees and we are going to run out of air to breath at some point if we continue like this. Thats why poeple should stop driving cars and ride a bike to there job or take the train. Also cars make geenhouse gas, cars are responsible for 12 persent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. We are also going to have less death because many people die in car axcidents and becuase of drunk drivers and less kids are going to be getting hurt or killed if there on the street because they dont have to worry about cars hitting them. For example if a kid is playing with a ball and the ball goes to the street the kid is probably going to go get it but he wont get hurt because there are no cars on the streets.

Eventhough cars cause greenhouse gas, air polution and death they are also very help full because if you have to go late at night to get food you have a fast way to get to the market because u have a car right out side your door. Also if something happens to your son in school or if u or someone needs medical attention you have a fast way to take them to the hospital or to get to were they are. But theres a down side if you go out to see what happend to you son in a hurry you probably going to have a car axcident and get seriously hurt or worst. Too many people use too many cars the streets are always crouded with cars at all times and some of these people drive crazy or they try to show of there car by going fast and end up getting killed or killing someone els.

This are some of the advantages of limiting car use less people would die,we would have more air to breath, and there would be less green house gas effect. And i think think that it is a good idea to stop using cars and take your bike to work because you would be helping earth and will be getting some exersice at the same time.

I have heard that you are deciding between two policies on the inhabitance of cell phones at school. I am writing this to state my opinion on this, and greatly suggest that I am all for Policy 1. I do feel that cell phones should be allowed to be of use in free time. Emergencies might happen, or maybe they forgot something and need to call home. I think it is necessary for a student in case of things.

First off, emergencies might or could happen. Whether it's some bleeding in the lower area of a female to a severe injury or sickness, cell phones would be useful to call a parent to tell them that they are not doing well. Students might even use their phones just to talk to other people in the school, but they should still acquire one just in case. Besides, it decreases the school's phones bill and teaches students responsibility to care for their own things.

Of course, things can get out of hand, since the phone is a way of communication. Bad things about one another can be said and can start confrontations or fights. But that is why there is suspension and discipline for that sort of thing. There are rebels out there, and whether you ban phones or not, they will most likely continue to have them in their possession.

These are just some of my reasons of having Policy 1. It's good incase of emergencies and for sickness and even for just pure fun. I really hope you consider my reasons and maybe select Policy 1. Well, that is all I have to say. See you at school again tomorrow!

So i recommend a policy number 3, which is: students should not be aloud to have phones out during school hours, they should be turned off, but they may take it out after school if they need to call someone. That way they will not be calling/texting any one during class, and if they are caught with the phone on, they should get it taken away until the end of the day .

Whether the decision be where to go for lunch or something that would alter your life people seek others opinion. Often times going to more than one person to get advice can be a very beneficial thing to do. Getting more than one opinion can be very helpful since it gives you more outlook on the question at hand. By asking more than one person you get multiple sides of your situation, their past experience in doing something similar, and in the end you will be more confident in your final choice.

Going to other for advice can really open your eyes to all sides of your dilemma. Perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. Asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. Then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. These people also may see things that you dont in a situation. Seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision.

Some of the people you would want to talk to probably have more experience than you do. This would be optimal considering they have already gone through something very similar and know which choices have a bad outcome. A family member, close friend, or anyone you trust really would be a good option for this. If they are older than you its likely they had to make some similar decision and will relate to you and your situation and try their best to help aid you in making a good choice. These people that have more experience in life and are willing to help you really make the difference and help you make the best choice possible.

After asking all these people and taking into consideration all of their opinions there should be a pretty clear final decision. Since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. Going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success.

My parents had found those words falling out of their mouths faster than they could stop it and louder each time that they were spoken. Years had gone by from when I had been previously hospitalized for a auto immune system disease, two to be exact, and I was back to where I was before. I began to have seizures and panic attacks regularly without a rhyme or reason which not only was unsettling but dangerous. My mom took me to the doctors and they wanted to send me away to some mental hospital. Both of my parents were taken aback at the lack of bedside manners and were concerned about the negative tone that this doctor was speaking in. When you ask for advice it's best that you ask not only one but multiple people because you never know if the person is biased, or if the person truly understands the question and even hearing the problem over again can help you analyze and find the best choice.

Mental health has been stigmatized for years and unfortunately that stigma prevented me from getting a quick diagnoses. My mom decided to take me to the doctors office after intense panic attacks, dissociation episodes and, seizures. The doctor had claimed that I was simply a nut case and that i was to be institutionalized. Even at the age of six I felt like I should hide my issues, that I shouldn't tell people how I felt because they would think less of me or they would think i was crazy. Until I met with a neurologist. The neurologist told me all about what was actually going on inside my brain and how I shouldn't be ashamed of it, but she also told me that some people are biased when it comes to mental health, and how some people don't believe that these issues even exist. I spent a while thinking about how many of the nurses and doctors I had seen and how they told me that i was just a little girl throwing temper tantrums, or that I had been sheltered too much as baby, and how no one ever wanted to talk about my mental health. Thats when i realized how a bias can change someone's opinion.

The unknown is something most people fear. It's only human to want to know everything, but sometimes we dont know things and that's a hard thing to admit especially when you are a doctor working on the case of a dying six year old. I had met doctors that have flat out told me that they didn't know what was wrong with my brain, but i've also met doctors that thought they did but really didn't. It was always you have this you have that and the second opinion was different from the first, and the third was different from the fourth. We couldn't find a common connection between each diagnoses. The treatments for each separate diagnoses wouldn't help me in fact they would hurt me more. Medicines and therapy were a constant for me, but the unknown didn't provide much information, so therapy was almost useless. We started to ask around everywhere for answers hoping someone knowledgeable would show up and help us.

It was four months into the mystery that was my brain, and frankly we were starting to lose hope. My body had taken a toll from various medicines and hospital trips, I was pulled out of school as well as dance. The only thing I could do was sit in the hospital bed and read. My one friend was my neurologist, she would come in and check up on me everyday when i was in the hospital. She would always listen to my mom's complaints or my father's awful jokes, she would constantly reassure my brother that i was going to be okay. Whenever she visited she would talk to me about things that she thought would help figure out what i had, that was when i realized that she hadn't once stopped thinking about this, we had told her so many times what was happening she was starting to put pieces together and make the best choice. One fateful day a doctor came in the room with a clipboard and paper, he simply handed it to my parents, and thats when a wave of relief flooded the room, we finally had a logical diagnoses. My neurologist had spent so much time listening to us and hearing this problem over and over again that it stuck with her, she eventually thought over it so many times that she figured out the best possible diagnoses and treatment.

""Encephalitis and a Micoplasma infection."" My Parents often find themselves using those words when describing how I have become such a curious and mature young woman. Making decisions is hard especially when you have to make them for yourself. My parents have always been supportive of letting me make decisions on my own, but they always gave me plenty of advice and during times like then advice is exactly what i needed but i also needed advice from someone other than my parents, and i made the hard decision that i would listen to the doctors as an adult would as well as listen to my parents to make my choice. The choice i made ended up being the best possible choice and i am forever grateful that i learned this lesson.

Asking for more than just one person for advice comes naturally to us. Getting advice from lost of people help us get through some bad hair days or tough situations, like fights with your loved ones. Seeking advice from more than just one person is helpful for solving situations because it gives you different opinions, helps you figure out what opinions most people agree on, and what you might not want to do in certain situations.

Getting advice from more than just one person gives you a lot of opinions. Everyone has their own way to handle situations or problems. So some people's opinions can be very similar to yours or the complete opposite. This can open up your mind on not just one problem, but many more in the future. It can be as simple as what chips should I get? Your friend might say a chip flavor that you would never try in a million years, but you try it out and turns out you like it! This opens up your mind in situations and how to handle them in different ways.

Another thing you learn is what opinions most people have in common. You hear a lot of advice from people but some of advice can be extremely similar to each other. This can help you find a good way on how to fix situations. It shows what most people agree on, and usually that is what can help you solve your situation the best. You tend to use advice that most people agree on so asking multiple people help you with what to do in tough situations.

Lastly some of the advice you receive you just don't think fits you or the way you like to handle things so you ask more people. Say you have drama between you and someone else, someone you ask might say fight that person but that's not really the way you want to handle it. So instead you ask more people for what they think you should do. This can help bring your mind to how you want to fix a situation. Everyone handles situations differently so this will can give you ideas on what to do and what not to do.

Seeking advice from multiple help you in many ways such as, giving you different opinions, what opinions people agree most on, and what not to do in certain situations. This really helps you clear your mind on how to solve a problem correctly and how you want to solve it. It also can narrow down ways you could solve a conflict.

I would just like to say that I think what you plan on doing to the sports and other activities isn't fair to students. Students should be able to participate in any sport or activities if they have a passing grade, and a C average is on that grade scale. Most people who are in sports these days don't have a B average, they have a C average.

And if you close it off for any students that have lower than a B average you would losing most of your players. Unless it's your goal, to lose all of the schools sports players and activities participator's. And I don't think it is, or I hope it's not.

This school is based off of the sports teams and the grades, but without a sports team the school would go down in education. Not only will students stop trying to get good grades but there parents would start getting mad about their kids not being able to participate in any sports or activities. Yeah I mean if you want to mess up the school's education than that's up to you, but your only ruining things for the students and the school. And most students come to this school because of the sports teams.

So if you limit it for other people than those people would want to go to a different school, and trust me you would lose a bunch of people. And most people don't want to leave this school because they like it the way it is now and changing it wouldn't help make it a better place to learn. So all I'm really saying is that if you change the grade average to a B you would be losing a lot of things and students.

This landform was created by natural causes; saying that it was created by a differrent lifeform is irrelavent. It's irrelavent because NASA would have a higher budget than we do now to explore further, if you take a look at the pictures the three are very distinct, and the third photo didn't show any other landforms, pyramids, houses, or lifeforms.

NASA's budget is assgined to them by the new discoveries they find in outter space.

151543,AAAXMP138200002190642125_OR,7B12C9A10547,train,"Online Schooling

Technology as a whole has developed drastically over the last decade. Technology is such an amazing and useful part of things we do every day. One of the most life changing technological advancements that have been made, is online schooling or at home schooling. There are many positive things about online schooling and how it has helped shape our society today. At home schooling is a great option for many students because they can learn at their own pace, go to schools further away, and be sick less often.

The first reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they could learn at their own pace. Many students struggle with the fast pace school environment. For example, students are required to get to class on time, turn their work in on time, and even write down notes while keeping up with their teachers. On the other hand, some students think that the curriculum is too slow paced. Likewise, some students feel as though they are given too much time for assignments, too much time to get to class, or even too much time to take notes. Overall, students have different rates of learning, and the school curriculum doesn't always take that into consideration. Based on this evidence, it is logical to assume that at home schooling can allow students to learn at their own pace.

The second reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they could be given the chance to go to schools further away. Many students aren't able to go to a preferred school because they are too far away. Giving students an opportunities to take classes at home and online could allow them to enroll in classes at schools that they would rather go to. Also, a student might want to take a specific class that the nearest school might not offer. Furthermore, some students may already know what they want to do for a career and if so, they might need to take a specific class before starting that career. If the school they are attending does not have that class, the student could be held back from their fullest potential. It is obvious that at home schooling could allow students to attend and take classes at schools that are further away.

The final reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they would be sick less often. With less human contact, students wouldn't be sick as often and wouldn't come in contact with as many harmful illnesses. Also, even if the student were to get sick, he or she would still be able to attend school with out infecting their peers or teachers. This would, in return, allow students to continue their education while being sick without the fear of getting anyone else sick. This could also help to stop the spread of harmful diseases like chicken pox, measles, and other easily transmittable illnesses. Naturally, allowing students to take online classes can help them to be sick less often.

Many people say that students who don't have access to internet would be at a disadvantage. However, those students would still be able to attend a regular, tangible school or they could use guide books for each class. Having online classes would just be easier to attend for those who do have internet access at home. Since students would be able to work at their own pace, go to school further away, and be sick less often, at home schooling would be a great option for many students. Our youth would be very well educated if more schools started offering classes at home. Our society and future generations would be better developed as well. So please, speak to your school board members and propose the idea of at home classes at you local schools and make your community a better place. ",5,1621710000000.0,381,434,At home schooling is a great option for many students ,Position,Position 1,Adequate,,,,Virginia,Independent,,Distance learning,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

15926,5354275,D389CF071335,train,"Life has revolved around driving since the termination of World War II. In sources 1 and 4, the authors mention the population's inhabitants have greatly reduced or stopped car usage wholly voluntarily. While in sources 2 and 3, the cities have banned car usage on certain days. The advantages of limiting car usage include less pollution and increased accessability to the entire city.

Pollution is an large issue in todays world. According to Rosenthal in source 1, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (P5)."" The use of cars has created smog in many large cities. The 2009 Olympics in Bejing required the city to reduce car usage in order to clear the air. Those participating and attending the event were in danger of harming their lungs. The citizens of Bejing has already been noted to wear respirators and other devices to filter the toxins from the air they breathe. In this extreme case, it was manditory to cut the usage of cars down. But in other cities, they have not reached this extreme and it can be easily prevented by limiting car usage. Duffer mentions the pollution in the skies of the global city of Paris has been noticably decreased(P19). In another scenario of pollution in the atmosphere, the city has taken initiative to ban cars depending on the number of their license plate. Without the emissions from the cars, the air would be clean to breath and a better sight as well.

The new generation has grown up with cars yet when the time comes to obtain a license, they forgo the oppurtunity. Selsky says that without cars, the city's parks and sports centers have been heavily visited. The pedestrian walkways and shopping centers have also came in large numbers(P28). Due to the abandonment of cars, upscale commerce and new restaurants were constructed. Rather than a large mall near some interstate or other large roadway, shopping districts have transformed into locations in which are near public transportation or in walking distance. Rosenthal shares an anecdote that outlines that public transportation, car-pooling, and even walking have replaced the car for himself and his children(P40). Public transit is not viewed down upon anymore, it is a smarter way of getting from one place to another. Car-pooling isn't a desprete call, it is a resource that has become essential and benificial to both parties. A combination of car-pooling, walking, and public transit makes the city much easier to access and explore.

The development of cities is no longer based on cars. It is now be based upon the access it will give to those without cars. Limiting the use of cars makes the city improved in many ways. Clean air and more efficient ways of transportation highlights that cars are no longer needed and limiting car usage will have even more advantages in the future.

I think the voting should be based off of the most popular vote. When we go to vote all we're voting for is electors to vote for the president they choose. In my opinion the people of the United States of america should get a saying in who they want as president. If the voting was based off of the most popular vote, it would be fair to everyone.

For example in 2000 when Al gore recieved more individual votes then George W. Bush and Bush one ,that was unfair because more poeple wanted Al Gore as their president rather than George W. Bush. The president is going to be ALL the people in the United States president, not just those 29 electoral voters president. In 2012 Obama won the election because of the 61.7 percent of the electoral votes not by individual votes. If the voting wasn't based off of the electoral votes than maybe the united states wouldn't be so much in debt and have so many people not wanting Obama as our president. Maybe Romney would have been a better president and have took the U.S out of so much debt. After all, 53.1 percent of individual voters voted for Romney.

Romney's chances of winning by electoral college were thin because since he was in the south he had no incentive to campaign heavily in those south states. Many voters don't vote because they know their vote won't matter at all when it comes to voting for  the president of their choosing. If 35 million people vote in California, it would only count as 55 representatives. Is their really a point of them voting? no point at all.

In conclusion, if you really want a fair win for the president ,the president should be chosen by the people , not the electoral college. When i'm old enough to vote i hope it will be based off of who the poeple want as their prestident not the electoral college.

It all started with a concept car.

We've become smarter as well and they'll find ways to creat a perfect driverless car before 2020.

"" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"", ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"", Pargraph eight.

People will still want a car that they can still control at anygiven moment.

Drivers might get bored but at least they know they are save.

The driver doesn't have to stare at the rode avery second.

They can do other things while the driverless car is driving itself.

If the driverless car needs the person to drive it will notifly the driver.

As for the laws that focus on keeping drivers, and anyone in the car safe.

I get those laws are made to keep people safe.

Once it shown that driverless car are safe you should make it legal to drive them.

Or should I say let them drive us.?

"" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" Pargraph nine.

It would be the both of their fault fault. The driver of buying and or maybe not paying attention.

The manufacture for not make the car right.

It all depends on what happened in the Accident.

You can also make the person who buys the driverless car to sign an agreement.

That says if a accident were to happen that it wouldn't be the manufacturers fault.

He or She will take all responsiblity for what happens in the accident.

All in all this is a very difficult argument.

I believe that every student should have to perform some type of community service because we should all give back to the community in one way or another or another, even if its just helping someone in their yard or going to a nursing home and sitting with the elderly just for them to have company.

We should perform community service so we can be prepared and ready for the world of work.

It would also be a good experience for us to help out in the community just to see what is going on in and around the community.

Community service would be a great idea because we could learn a lot about the people in our community and get to know them in a friendly and personal way.

It may take up lot of our spare time but I believe that it is worth it.

Community service is a great service to have on any applications for college and even when we are searching for a job after college.

Most businesses now hire workers that have experience and who have done community service. Also, we would become well respected and trusted if we have helped out and donated our time to help out around and in the community.

Helping out in the community would be a great thing for students who want to go to college and who want to achieve a decent , nice paying job in the future.

It can also lead to kids living a healthy lifestyle. There could be a potential basketball player that does not know what he is capable of and he could find it through sports. When they work in the yearbook they can find someone who is new to the school and make them feel welcomed. They can find things they never knew that they liked. This can lead to a better school and community.

When a student is forced to do something first they don't like it but then it can lead to many different things in the future. For example, you don't know if you like something until you try it. It is the same way with sports. What if there is a kid that plays basketball for fun but he does not want to try out. Now he can try out and if he really likes it he can furthermore better his skills at it. What if because he had to do the bare minimum of one activity he gets many scholarships in high school and goes to the NBA. Just because of that one activity.

Students have a tuff time fitting in sometimes and it can help by doing extracurricular activities. For example, both students both like taking pictures but they don't think anything of it. They both join the yearbook program which takes pictures of students and faculty. Then they meet and then they become good friends. Just because of that one activity that they had to do. They become a wedding photographers.

If you have then don't take offense to it. They only want to make sure they get the right answer. People ask more than one person because someone might not know the answer, one answer might be false, and someone may lie.

First, the person might not know the answer. If a traveler asks you for directions to the interstate and you don't know how to get there, then he or she has to go to another person and ask them. The person that the traveler goes to next for directions after you might not know so the traveler just keeps going. If you don't know the answer tell the traveler that you don't know so they don't get mad at you for giving the wrong information. Therefore, tell the traveler that you don't know the answer.

Secondly, somebody's statement might be false. If somebody's statement is false then you have to ask another person. If somebody says something false and you believe them then you might regret not asking another person. Don't believe anybody unless you have confirmed it with multiple people you trust. Therefore, always see if the person's statement is true or false.

Finally, somebody you ask might lie to you. Even though somebody might really help you and you don't listen to them, still check around. If somebody does lie to you then you can figure it out by asking around. If you do ask multiple people then it doesn't matter if one of them lied. Therefore, make sure nobody is lying to you.

There are also bad things that aren't beneficial from community service. This is because some kids need time to focus on school priorities as well. For example, say you had an essay paper to do but you had to do community service but you don't finish later.

Driverless cars are a new invention where cars that do not require a driver to have control of the vehicle at all times. These vehciles will have basic driving skills. Think of all the benefits and oppertunities this new invention could bring to our society.

As almost everyone knows driving is a basic skill of being an adult. Sometimes though, adults can get very busy, sidetracked, or be multitasking. It is a normal thing and I am sure everyone does it, but unfortuntaly being sidetracked may mean getting into accidents. With this new driverless cars, the car drives for you, so if you need to apply your makeup or pick up a toy for your child that is crying in the back seat, you can! Have you ever backed out of a busy parking lot and slammed into a shopping cart that was just too tiny to see? Well with the driverless cars, they have sensors and will alert you. GM's invention has been to vibrate the driver's seat to alert the drivers, pretty neat, right? Toyota Prius's latest technolgy is there are 3-D laser beans around the car so if another car, person, etc. come close to the vehicle it will move out of the way, or take procautioins like an actual drive would do. I believe that these cars may be beneficial to new drivers like teenagers as well. The reason I say this is because a new driver needs to watch and see how to properly drive, if the new driver watched the basic skills of the driverless car, it may benefit him/her for when they star to drive independently. I think that with any type or design of vehicle procautions will have be taken into place and lots of research and factors will go into play. Many people are concerned about the liablities and if something would go wrong what they would do, who would be responsible. I believe that the damage and facts would have to be carefully examined, just like any car accident. With this being said, I think the rate of car accidents will decrease because there will not be any distractions for the driver in the car, and it will be quicker for the driver to be notified if something were to go array.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020! Is that not amazing? Think of all the new oppertunities and safety that we will have!

55591,AAAVUP14319000033117,3C01D1FB2BBF,train,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved. The author throroughly describes the immersive learning possibilities that could be discovered by studying the foreign planet, the surviveable and safe travel conditions for humans, and other exploration options to ensure a safe and efficient venture to Venus.

First of all, the author immediately combats the argument of Venus being too dangerous to venture. When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.

Furthermore, the author heavily emphasizes the learning opportunities that exploring the foreign planet would undoubtedly provide us. While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.

Finally, the author provides numerous options being developed for humans to embark in safe and efficient travel to Venus. When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.

Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines.

First of all, in 1976, when the picture was taken, technology wasn't the best, so it could have been some lack of better technology that could've made it look like a face. In paragraph 10, the author states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Also, in paragraph 11, the author says, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These two quotes state that the improvement of technology has proved that this isn't any Martian-made object.

Secondly, the 2001 camera's high resolution allowed a closer and more evidential look. Again, in paragraph 10, the author states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This quotation's second reason proves that the camera could zoom in closer and get evidence to support that the formation is not a face.

Lastly, the formation is just a natural landform called a ""mesa."" The author says, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" In comparison, paragraph 12 claims, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" Both of these quotes tell us that scientific research proves that the Face on Mars is fake, and that it is actually a mesa.

The Face on Mars in the region of Cydonia is actually a mesa. I feel that the Face on Mars is causing too much of a controversy. I hope that as technology improves, we can get better views on the landform to get better evidence that it is a Mesa and not a Martian-made face.",4,1618360000000.0,227,398,"First of all, in 1976, when the picture was taken, technology wasn't the best, so it could have been some lack of better technology that could've made it look like a face.

People do not realize the kind of accident they can cause by replying back to a text or just reading one. That one simple reply can take someone else's life in a blink of an eye. Once it happens there is no going back, it's not like a message where you can delete or go back to that one specific text.

In fact, using your cell phone is a bad choice to do while driving on the road. There are people with kids in their car trying to get back home or on their way to spend time with some family. Most of these people do not make it back home or to their destination due to either a car accident caused by people who are distracted on their phone. There are children who do not know that a simple phone they use to watch videos on is a bad thing for them. Not only is it a bad thing but it can cause serious outcomes to anybody who is just driving and going on with their life.

To tell the truth, the use of cellphones while driving is illegal in most places. People can get a ticket and get fined for doing so. There are many penalties that people can receive from getting a ticket. For example, some may pay the fine and get demerit points to your license. These demerit points provide a balance and check anyone's driving; they are either added or subtracted from your license. These point vary based on the type of convictions you get. If you go over the number of demerit points based on the type of license you have your license may be suspended. People need to know that you will get a consequence for using your cellphone while driving. It may not seem like a big deal but in the real life it is.

As a final point, the use of any type of cell phone should not be allowed by anyone who is driving. No one really knows the kind of danger cell phones be putting people in. Yes it's a small device almost as big as the size of your hand but it can cause a serious accident. Cell phones may not seem like a big deal to people nowadays but in reality they can be deadly.

In the pictures my crew (NASA) and I took may look like it has changed over the years but it really has not changed at all. Our picture in 1976 has a lack of good quality. From that point forward our quality has got a lot more visible.

I believe the face on Mars is a natural landform, and also there are no aliens up on Mars to make this face.

The face on Mars is a natural landfrom because in paragraph seven in the article states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all."" That is saying no alien was up there to create the landform. If there was aliens up there NASA would have annouced it. We NASA have taken pictures of Mars and have not seen any aliens upon there.

Also stating in paragraph eleven ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Saying that if there are aliens on Mars you would be able to see them on there, but you can not.

So, proven right there that there are not aliens on Mars plain and simple. This face is popular as it gets! Everyone needs to know it was not created by aliens because if it was we would already know by now in this point in time. That face on Mars is not made by aliens, it is made natural.

The face on Mars is made naturaly simple as that I can not get more simple than that.

I a NASA scientist believe that it was made naturaly no figure, no alien was up on Mars physically making faces on Mars. If we were to go up to Mars right now we would not see any alien. Anytime you hear ""Aliens on Mars created the face of Mars"" just know it is a myth. There is no aliens up on Mars, and there will never be aliens on Mars.

The reason I believe that the electoral college should be abolished is because I don't believe it is benefiting any elections at all. And a lot of people do not believe in it either. In source two Bradford Plumer said ''what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce been trying to do, abolish electoral voting.'' I think that the electoral college makes the president elections to close to tie, and that could be a catastrophe. However source three has made some pretty good points on the electoral college. Saying that '' if there was no electoral college there would be no winner-take-all system.'' this would a terrible problem for the canidates and the voters, and would ruin the whole election.

Therefore sources two and three makes some pretty valuable and good points, but I still think source two makes more sense to me. In source three Richard A. Posner wrote '' it is the electors who elect the president not the voters. When your voting for a president canidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. I dont agree that electors decide what we voted for, because then whats the point of voting for a canidate if your not even choosing at all. America is a democracy and having someone choose your president for you is not showing that we live in a democratic nation. We need to choose so we can learn from our own mistakes and then we won't make them again.

This just shows that the House Of Represenatives and the government don't trust us at all and that we cant make good decisions. Source one doesnt say anything about being against or with it but it did point out some interesting facts about the electoral college. The office of the federal register wrote '' the electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'' What their saying is that we might not have huge say on the election but we do have a pretty big say on it. I don't that we have any say on it what so ever, and that is because of the slate of electors.

In conclusion, I agree with what source two had to say because of the great points they made and the facts that led me to belive that the electoral college does not work at all.

Have you ever worked to be apart of something bigger than yourself? It's a great feeling! Whether it be a group project or the school play; it's all a group effort. Everyone having at least one extracurricular activity gives us students the chance to develop their skills and talents, it'll give us experience for our future work place, and give us a chance to make ever lasting friendships bettering the group efforts.

Working on an extracurricular activity can help us learn talents and while developing older skills. Some students may learn important social skills and, other can develop those skills. Many students have hidden talents yet, might not ever be able to use it if they're just doing standard desk work. I hope with this new rule we can all express ourselves while learning from valuable experience.

In recent years, studies have shown that 66% of students who joined a club or have done an extracurricular have a higher chance of getting into colleges or getting a job. A lot of people can benefit from extra work experiences. Jobs and colleges are looking for talented individuals who know how to work. I think that is reason enough to start this program.

These activities give students who only want to socialize with people like them a place to meet others. Students with similar interests working together can be a force of good. When you get to learn and work beside those who you are comfortable with you'll do and feel much better. With everyone working together and no one is excluded everyone gets to help out and be apart of the group.

Giving student a place where they can learn and develop talents and skills while also giving them work experience and, helping the meet new people is definitely a good idea. A school where students are able to express themselves in their own creative groups. That will not only give us great memories but, will also help us as adults.

123903,5178619,96BF2953ED8F,train,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I believe that the way our elections are run are not what is best for the United States. The Electoral College is changing the way that we originally set out to vote and is making things unfair for the citizens who vote. I propose that the Electoral College is taken away all together in order for elections to be more fair, and more like the original intention of the U.S. With most states following the winner takes all idea, the winner of the general public may not be the candidate that wins the elections. These times are rare, but they happened before there is nothing that is stopping them from happening again.

A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election.

Another reason that this process is so unstable is the way that it makes voters feel about voting. In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference.

Some argue that a few votes can not do a lot and that the Electoral College is a far more organized way to conduct the voting. But every vote counts, and if every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may be a majority favorite. It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it?

I think that it is criticall that we change the idea of an Electoral College to the idea that all of the people in the United States are able to contribute equally to who should be the next president based on what they believe is right. Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way (The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer.) A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College.

There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it. I hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the Electoral College is accomplished soon.

If the whole world took part in what Columbia does each year, then our world could be so much cleaner. Even after Paris reduced the amount of cars used for only five days, the congestion had gone down sixty percent.

By reducing the amount of cars which take over the road, the amount of accidents would be profusely lowered as well. Cars are excellent sources of transportation, but they are also the leading cause of death around the world.

Anyone who has ever used a car knows very well how expensive it can be to maintain a car. A monthly gas bill could add up to hundreds, oil changes, tire rotation, and all the other things required in keeping a car will add up to be very costly.

As a result of lowering car usage, people could benefit from it by getting daily exercise. In America the percentage of obesity is high compared to the rest of the world. People rely on cars to bring them places and they forget the fact that they also need daily exercise. Exercise is known to help relieve anger and clear the mind. By walking, skating, biking, or even rollerblading, we would allow ourselves time to think when we are upset or frusterated or maybe even happy! The streets would be much safer if there weren't people who had mixed emotions driving around.

Decreasing the amount of cars on the road defintely has benfitted all the countries that have taken part in it. There are no major disadvantages of being ""car free"". Most Americans do have abililty to drive a car so the thought of not having a car could be upsetting.

Our communtiy would benfit from this change vastly. It doesn't have to be forever, but decreasing car usage would be helpful to our big world.

123088,5076422,5773EED58DF2,train,"Dear Senator of Florida,

I belive the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. The electoral college should be abolished because it does not benefit the U.S. in anyway and has caused multiple problems in elections over the past years. The electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only causes issues while elections are present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote.

The electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems. The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated ""the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.

The electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way. The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don't always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that dosent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote. Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee so nothing can happen but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues.

The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.                    ",5,1615840000000.0,26,99,I belive the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. ,Position,Position 1,Effective,,,,Florida,Text dependent,"Source 1: ""What is the Electoral College?"", by the Office of the Federal Register

First reason why they should is because they would not get disracted by other students or things they could just be able to focus on wht the teacher is saying. The second reason why shudents should have online classes is that they can finish everything faster or on their own pace. The third reason why i think they should have it done at home is because they could get help from their parents or siblings if they are struggling with a homework or classwork. The forth reason why they should is that, if two students that are siblings and are taking the ame classes they could be able to do it together and they wouldn't struggle that much because they could depend on each other, but if they are both stuggling they could just have an online conversation with the teacher and get help from him/her. The fifth reason is that if the students took their tests at home they wouldnt be able to cheat on it because the school could have a website or an app that once you get in to an app and sign in and start the test you would not be able to get out of the app and if you do it would log out and once you get back in it would be locked until a parent is home so they could watch you take the test and so the teacher would unlock it once the parents let the teacher know that they would be home watching their child. The sixth reason why they should do that is because they could finish the class that they take faster than you would be able to finish in school because you would have it everyday and finish everything quicker and graduate easier.

25208,AAAXMP138200000493152144_OR,A451B2D00666,train,"It's a week before your junior year starts. You're laying in bed, soaking up your last few days of freedom. Then it hits you- you have a book report due the first day of school. Panic sets in, chaos erupts. Oh, the joy of summer projects. Most students have been through the process of completing a summer project. In most circumstances, these projects are a strict set of directions created by the teacher. Summer projects are expected, especially when taking difficult classes. Students, due to different commitments, should be able to design their own summer projects.

Teenagers today are exposed to a lot more than when our parents were our age. Some of those things aren't beneficial, such as too much screen time or drinking underage. But, a lot of this exposure is good. We're exposed to different cultures at an early age, we have easier access to education, and we know when disaster strikes, it's our responsibility to help. Because of all this new exposure, students often make commitments over the summer. Students accepted into college summer programs go to learn more about something their interested in. Some make the world a better place by doing service with a church group or other organizations. College is expensive, so a large quantity of teenagers get a summer job to save up money. There's always going to be the group of teenagers who sit at home all summer watching TV and eating junk food. With this wide variety of responsibilities and commitments, having every student complete the same exact summer project is unreasonable.

At most schools, you don't meet your teacher until a week prior to school starting. Knowing nothing about the class is a scary thought if you're spending hours a day working on a summer project, assigned by a teacher you've never met. If students know nothing about a teacher and the class they lead, how are they supposed to know if they're going to stay in the class? It's ridiculous to ask for a teenager to commit to an intensive project when they might only be in the class for a day. Most schools that allow schedule changes will forget about that grade if you drop the class early on into the school year. It may be nice that you don't have to be in that class anymore, but hours upon hours of your life were wasted on a project you'll never get a grade for. If students were able to design their own summer project, it would not only give them creative freedom but allow them to feel proud of what they turn in, regardless if they stay in the class. No student enjoys writing an essay every time they do a project, so if the projects were created by students the final results could be even more outstanding than what any teacher could've designed.

If students are designing their own summer projects, it not only shows their personality and character- it raises their expectations for the class in the best way possible. Most teachers want their students to be excited for their class. Even if the class course is torturous, a teacher who loves their job can make all the difference in the world. If a teacher gives their students the freedom of creating their own summer project, the students will have a good image of the teacher. Students that enjoy a class tend to be the ones who do the best. Most teenagers don't enjoy being tied down by rules, so getting them excited for a class that has rules is the ideal situation.

Summer projects aren't a bad thing. They not only keep a student's brain activated during the summer, but they give them a taste of a class before they commit fully. Because of all the opportunities we have as teenagers in today's age, our schedules can get pretty busy. Although, I do still think an education is important. Summer projects allow students to ease themselves back into the routine of the school year before it hits them like a train. If those projects are student designed, it allows us to learn about time and self management. They also allow us to express our creativity. I'm not saying someone who draws a stick figure should get the same credit as someone who writes a five page essay. In my ideal situation, the teacher can give their students a vague set of directions so the students are free to express themselves. ",5,1619400000000.0,0,479,"It's a week before your junior year starts.

As you know some of the students of this school like too do community service also you know some don't enjoy doing community service. In my opinion I believe that community service is good but should not be required to all students.

The reason I believe that community service should not be required is, some students even though they are required will not do the community service making it unfair for the students that do enjoy doing community service.

Another reason I believe that community service should not be required is, some students may have other activities they may have to do instead of the community service such as church or maybe a family situation.

Also, another reason that I believe that community service should not be required is, even though they join in the task of community service they might get frustrated because they are forced to do so and could create a problem between there self and other students.

The final reason I believe that community service should not be required is, some students may not be able to come and join the other students because they may not have a source of transportation.

In conclusion I believe that community service should not be required because some students wouldn't come, another reason is some may have other activities they have to do, also how some students may make a good thing into something bad, and lastly some students may not be able to come join the activity with the other students because they have no source of transportation.

Your mind races you think of all the things you could do, you think of chess club or the football team. That is what happened to me and if I am being honest i think it is a good idea, to have students participate in something and not just sit around, i think it is a good idea because it keeps students healthy and active.

There are many sports, I even play play a few myself such as baseball, swim team and football. if not a sport than a student can join a club such as decorating a yearbook or or act as a member on a student council which is very important if a student wanted to pursue a career in the government.

activities such as these are very important for brain development and creating social skills. even if you despise doing activities such as these there are so many options they are also very good for making friends, some of my closest friends i have met through base ball or swim team.

But i understand how some people can not like these things they could have social anxieties or maybe they are not good at sports i understand but having them be required to do such a thing i think is good. giving people an excuse to go outside and actually do something like hangout with friends or be an active member of the community is awesome and more people should do that. or just act in there school as someone who dose something for the community.

That is why people should do things like play sports or help out in their community is it look good on your resume for colleges and con help you if you need references for jobs in the future that is one of the many reasons i agree and i think you should to because even if you dont like sports or clubs or thing like that they are still very important.

That is why think it is so important so if the school besides to implement this change i would support it and encourage you to do the same. it is a good way to make friends it looks good to collages and there are so many other good things about it and i think it is better to the alternative which is just doing nothing and so that is what i think about the topic.                   ",3,1616000000000.0,963,1153,"even if you despise doing activities such as these there are so many options they are also very good for making friends, some of my closest friends i have met through base ball or swim team.

48996,AAAVUP14319000033635,B5D9F34D2CAC,train,"Have you ever wondered what it is like in Venus and how we might be able to study more about it. Studying Venus closely is worth the risk for more information on Venus. With the information it could lead scientists into making better technology to explore mars or other planets. The exploration could also be our backup Earth if the current Earth in inhabitable. With all the risk it may not be possible to explore Venus but if you are determined to find the answers then it could be possible.

There would be all sorts of information if we studied Venus closely. There are a lot of problems but it is still possible. There are a lot of people that wants to know more about Venus. For example on paragraph 4 it states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is stating that Astronomers know that one day Venus will change and humans will be soon able to land on it without much difficulties.

The information just from Venus could even help us explore other planets and solar systems far from our solar system. With the information we could possibly find another earth-like planet faster or easier. On paragraph 8 it states, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This quote is stating that our curiousty will soon take us over and eventually humans will do anything to findout more about Venus or anything in general. I believe that someday we will be able to find the truth about Venus and more information or data that can help us with exploring other planets.

All of us have thought of what will happen if the current Earth we live on is destroy or inhabitable. Well our 2 options are either Mars or Venus, if we knew more of the planet Venus and how it behaves. On paragraph 4 it says that, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This is stating that Venus could return or we can make it return to how it was originally and possibly live on it. This is a good reason I think Venus will be able to accept humans and find more facts and informations.

In conclusion we have wondered how things are in Venus. We even wanted to know what would happen to humans if they went to Venus. There would be lots of information if we visited and came back perfectly. With all those information we got from visiting Venus it could help us with other difficulties from different planets.

139697,AAAXMP138200001655412125_OR,7D95539DC1AE,train,"At first thought, distance learning may seem like an easy way out for kids who just want to skip school to not be held accountable for it; however, while it may seem counter-intuitive to allow students to decide to take their classes online, it can often times be very beneficial for both those who take advantage of the option and those who continue a traditional path of school. By allowing students the option to choose their learning environment then it lets students decide whether they learn best from the comfort of their own home, a classroom, or anywhere else. In addition, giving students the option to decide where and how they learn best allows more sick students to stay home rather than come to school because they won't have to worry about falling behind on schoolwork. Some people may think distance learning is just a way for kids to take an easy way out of their education, simply because they are lazy; when, in fact, distance learning is not only a way for children to experience different class styles, but it is also a way for students to do their part in reducing the spread of communicable diseases.

It is a common belief that the best education comes from inside a classroom and other means of education are somehow lesser than a classroom education. This may be true for many people but it is definitely not true for everyone. Classrooms are often loud and crowded which allows even the most well intentioned students the chance to be distracted by their peers. Sometimes these classrooms are almost uncontrollable which leads the teachers to stop even trying to teach. This, in turn, leaves students who truly wanted to learn at a disadvantage because now their teacher has lost their motivation to teach. Distance learning can not only reduce the physical class sizes and make them more manageable, but it can also allow students who have a tendency to be more rowdy the option to see if removing themselves from the presence of people helps them focus better on their work. Aside from the educational benefits, there can also be health benefits.

One of the biggest reasons illness can spread so quickly in school is because students feel that unless they are so sick that they cannot function in school they should come to school because their attendance outweighs the potential spread of an illness. While they may be able to make it through all of their classes without much issue, the burden now falls onto all their classmates who were in contact with them all day. By allowing students to do distance learning, this issue of attendance is eliminated because the students who are sick but not suffering too heavily from the symptoms will be allowed to attend their classes from home so they can take the day off to help prevent the spread of illness without having to worry about all the work they may have missed. In addition, this can help a variety of students who miss school for extended periods of time because of issues such as injury, hospitalization, and even some mental health issues. If these students know they can easily make up the work before they even return to school it can take one less stress off them so they can focus on whatever issue they are dealing with. This may actually result in a decrease of the length of time that students are out of school.

Many who oppose allowing distance learning may say that students who do not attend class will have more distractions, and therefore a worse education; however, these people mistakenly conflate attendance with a good education. Often times students in class who are distracted will end up taking other students' focus along with them as their distraction distracts others. Students doing distance learning they won't have to worry about outside distractions so students who truly want to focus can put themselves in an environment that best suits their learning style. Another point people who oppose optional distance learning may make is that by allowing students the choice to learn from home many will just stop their studies all together. While in some cases this may be true, the people who would stop their education when given the option of distance learning are the same people who would drop out of high school even without distance learning. By giving students more control over their education through distance learning the people who want to succeed are given more resources to further their education which is truly important.

Giving students the option to have distance learning could be extremely beneficial to not just the individuals who decide to try it, but it can also be beneficial for those who feel they need the in person experience with a teacher. It is an understandable assumption that when left to their own devices students will just quit learning all together, but this is not frequently the case. During many arguments where school systems are being called into question or policies are being added the opposition makes the argument that the change will cause an overall decrease of productivity rather than an increase. Though this may be because people are prone to opposing change so just like giving students individual computers has worked in many school systems, the option of distance learning may one day prove to improve more than it damages. However, the only way to truly see if distance learning works or not is to actually implement it in schools, even for just a year, to assess the data and decide whether or not it should be continued.",5,1621710000000.0,1275,2073,"This may be true for many people but it is definitely not true for everyone.

For example, math is a subject that involves a lot of problem solving and can be very challenging to one learning. You have to workout problems and write things down in order to solve the problem. Some students aren't skilled enough to hear how to solve and then do it themselves. Less skilled students need the teacher in person showing them how to complete the problem rather than telling them how to solve it. That's how it is with all subjects, not just math. Students can benefit way more from a teacher showing them how to do something instead of telling them how to do something.

A conference over the phone or a webcam and online education can be very tricky. Phones and computers don't always work. At times they can stop working and shut down. If that happens then you won't be able to learn at all. On the other hand, going to an actual school and learning is way easier than that. All it requires is a chalkboard or a white board and a marker and your good to go. Teachers don't have to rely on a computer or phone when their teaching in a classroom. In some cases teachers will you use a computer to show a video or a program for students to learn from. but that doesn't mean they have to stop teaching at that point. Meanwhile, if a student is at home learning or on a conference with a teacher and your phone and computer stops working then you have no other choice then to stop working. It could happen once and have a student miss out on a lot of education. Online education or a video conference isn't a reliable way of learning. However, a student can always rely on going to school and having a teacher ready and prepared to teach.

There's visual learners and there's learners who can succeed by hearing. A visual learner wouldn't be able to learn if they did online education. They would be setup for failure because the school didn't organize the education around the student. Making an option for a student to learn from a video conference or online is a risk schools would have to take. Some students could choose that option but end up failing because they didn't know how well they learn online or from a video conference. Another risk with that option is some students might take advantage of it and choose it so they can stay home and not participate. Some students may choose the option of learning online but instead of doing that they could do other things. However, if they go to school then they have no other choice but to learn. They also wouldn't be allowed to do anything but learn because their is a teacher present and can monitor everything they do. Offering those ways of learning as an option is a huge risk. Students could take advantage of it and fail the whole purpose of allowing those options. Schools could get a lot of hate for it if the students use them and don't follow the rules. No school should ever want that happening to them. That's why there are many risks in allowing students to learn through an online or a video conference.

Going to school and learning is a much safer option than learning online or through a conference. There's a lot more benefits and many great things that come with it. Students are setup for success by attending school rather than learning online. They also have a higher chance of succeeding. Some students may do better learning online than others but it's still better going to school and learning. It's also a much safer option. I know I would do better going to school and learning. I would get distracted by my phone or video games or tv and then I wouldn't get any work done. If I'm at school I know I would get way more work done than I would if I was at home. Teachers are able to help me with my work and also keep off my phone. I often procrastinate while I'm working at home and it's hard to focus in that type of work enviroment. Meanwhile, if I'm at school teachers are there to keep me on track and help me on my path to finishing all of my work. I think I can speak for most students when I say that. We all love doing other things rather working on our work and if we can find any opportunities to get out of doing work then we will. Online education and a video conference are very easy to get out of if your not at school with a teacher watching.

Some might say that if your learning online from home your parents can watch you or supervise. Yes that's true but some students may go to their room and work or say their working when they're really not. For example, one may be doing their work one moment and the next moment their doing something completely different. Once again that's another reason why going to school is a much safer option than learning online. Even though some students can succeed learning online others can't. Teachers shouldn't have to waste their time only teaching a couple students in class when others are at home learning. Having to go to school and being face to face with a teacher learning from them can benefit students way more than learning online or through a video conference can.",6,1621260000000.0,1164,1284,A conference over the phone or a webcam and online education can be very tricky.

130215,2221000124,57BD9065E3EC,train,"Dear principal,

It is hard to decide whether or not cell phones should be aloud on school campuses or to be used during school.

You should take advice from students attending your school as well as parents and staff members.

In my perspective as a student, I believe that we should be aloud to have our phones during school but to only on during breaks such as lunch.

Cell phones may seem like a distraction but they can be very helpful during school.

Cell phones can be useful for internet, language tools, and communication.

First, cell phones can be a major help by using the internet.

Students can use the internet on their phones to research facts for a homework assignment or project.

Sometimes students are not able to access a computer and when they have an assignment due the next day it would be a reliable source to use.

Some student may misuse the use of cell phones but it is not right to take that privilege away from everyone. CLOSING SENTENCE!!!

Second, cell phones can also be a help to students who need translaters or help spelling a word.

If a student is not able to use a computer, they would be able to use their phone to finish an assignment.

Tools like this are educational and will help a student learn.

Third, cell phones can be a great source of communication.

Students can get tired of having to go up to an office to use a student phone, just for a simple question they have to ask their parents.

Also, when parents have jobs, they will not get fired or a detention for someone calling them.

Students sometimes have emergencies where their is not enough time to go to the office and it is easier to text whoever they need.

As students get older, they realize the importance usually of education and don't mess around with their phones.

Cell phone should not be forbidden at school and should at least be accessible during breaks.

In conclusion, schools should be aloud to use cell phones during breaks but not during school hours unless necessary.

Cell phones can be a great help from the use of internet, language tools, and communication.

If a student is not able to use a computer, a phone would be very helpful for research.

I think that your idea is good but i think it need some minor changes. This is indeed a great idea in the nutshell but there are some things that I must argue about. Such as the fact that some kids are just bad a school but great at sports, also it think that this rule should change when it come to the reasons as to why they have a C or a D.

Your idea is great but it need a bit of fine tuning along the lines of the mental capacity of the kids. There are some people that are the greatest of athletes in our school but some of them just cant learn properly. So consider this: if we have a super basketball player but he or she is a bit slow thus they have a C and you kick them off the team that seems a bit unfair. Also if the child is an immigrant they might not be able to learn for a while and once thy do learn the time for their sport might be already over. Also what if the child is not a bad kid just that he came back from a vacation and has a lot to catch up to and they have a C then its not very fair.

There are some bad sides to this issue but there is also good reasoning to this. After all why should kids who don't care about school be aloud to join a sports team? The ability to do a sport is a privilege and they should work for it. then again the grades might be perfect but the kids citizenship is horrible that's a different story altogether. I under stand why you did this but I think that you should put this into affect after the season is over so the kids have time to adjust to the change right now it seems like its just out of the blue.

I think that this is a good idea but you shouldn't base it on grades, instead you should base it on citizenship marks. Like I said what if the kid is a bit slow and cant help but get bad grades then what? My idea is to use citizenship marks to define weather or not to let them join sports. If that doesn't suit you then i suggest to first check their background first before you decide any ways I still think that you should put this rule into affect after this trimester so kids can adjust.

Now that we don't have to wonder anymore, NASA will try to take it one step higher. They want to be as close to Venus' ground as possible, without dying.

It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels.

Asking more than one person for advice gives options for whats right or wrong in anybodies opinion. Advice is getting support when you are not sure how handle or fix a problem. Many people ask for advice from friends, doctors, therapist, parents, siblings, you can get advice from anybody that you feel comfortable with. Therefore, Advice can benefit you emotionally and mentally, helps with later decisions in life, and develops you to ask for help when you need it.

It can be hard and easy to ask for advice, but it's worth seeing different perspectives and opinions from multiply people that you trust. This can help later in life when you can make decisions for yourself and decide on what you think is good for this problem, and make a effective solution. Asking a teacher for advice, then asking your parents for advice can be different, or it could also be the same and that's okay. This makes your brain work and really think, will this help me? Or will it make me regret it for this rest of my life? It's not easy to make these decisions, but it helps to know what you can do with your information. ""Make dew."" is a popular saying, meaning to work it out, you will know what's right and wrong, because you control what happens with you and your future.

Traumatic events happen, even if you do not appreciate it happening, or even if the chances are dramatically low. It can still occur, and you cannot avoid it. This can be very emotional or devastating for a lot of people, going to doctors and therapist can help you get through it when asking for advice. Its their job to be there for you and people just like you. Telling them how you feel will make you feel better, even if its just the slightest it can make a difference, and that just happens when they are just sharing their opinion and being there for you. Connecting with other people with experience like you can help. Asking for their advice can help as well, because it can be similar traumatic events that both participants have gone through. It won't be easy, but it makes you grow as a person and letting go of the feelings and share. Doctors, therapist, and people with similar events, will not have the same exact opinion or advice, it does not mean they are wrong.

The more you ask for something, the better. You get better at getting what you prefer out there, instead of keeping it to yourself and regretting it later. Asking for help is major, its okay to ask for help, its okay to feel uncomfortable when you do ask for help. Its not going to be easy for everyone. That's why we have so much leadership in our life, thats why parents, friends, doctors, grandparents, are here for your help. They are here for your back support. If you can't tell your own parents that something wrong is going on, it can be difficult for you. Therefore, practice and don't be afraid, because it's your parents job to make you feel better, and help you to get on the right track.

Advice helps you learn and feel good about yourself. It helps with relationships, projects, school, stress, goals, occupation, and lastly life. Advice will be always be around for you to use. Asking for ideas and direction will make you stronger, wiser, and can make people trust you for advice. Help is not something you should be afraid of. You embrace it. Asking for help does not make you're weak, it makes you feel better. Not asking for help doesn't mean you're strong and doesn't make you smart either.

144525,AAAXMP138200001856402125_OR,B1687066F985,train,"With the growth of technology, options, other than the traditional schooling, have developed, leaving schools to wonder if they should adapt to the new technologies by allowing classes to be attended online via video conference. Although some may believe otherwise, students can benefit from being able to attend online class from home because students can manage their time and can work at their own pace.

First of all, students will benefit from online class because they can manage their own time. For instance, my friend Generic_Name, who is a dancer and soccer player, takes classes online, so she has more time to attend her ballet classes and club soccer practices everyday. Because Generic_Name does not have to get dressed or commute to and from school, she can focus that additional time to dedicate to her interest in dance and sports while still maintaining her education. In addition, after my ACL and meniscus surgery, I had to take a week off of school to recover, which is a difficult amount of time to miss when being enrolled in all AP and honors courses. In preparation for my surgery, I asked all my teachers for notes and assignments that I would be missing, however, I only anticipated to miss half a week, so I was two days behind on my school work. With online classes, I could have managed more time to allow for a proper recovery and would not have fallen behind. Thus, online classes are useful in facilitating the growth of other interests and compensating for states of emergency where one may not be able to physically attend school.

Secondly, students will benefit from attending class online because they can work at their own pace. In U.S. History, for instance, my teacher Generic_Name would talk through the notes very quickly, so it was difficult for me to keep up, especially since I am a slow writer. Fortunately, Generic_Name makes the powerpoints available on blackboard, so I use that during class, but I am so invested in trying to write down all the notes that I miss the important information that he was explaining. In this situation, it would have been beneficial to attend that class from home because I could listen to his lecture intently and then take the notes afterward, which I would not have been able to do in class because Generic_Name disapproves of people not taking notes. Additionally, precalculus is a particularly easy class for me, so I often find myself sitting at my desk doing nothing after finishing the practice problems early. If I were to attend class online, I would be able to finish the lesson quickly and efficiently, shortening a 90 minute lesson to 30. Therefore, online courses enables students to utilize the time needed to take in and comprehend a lesson.

Some may disagree that students should be able to attend class online because students may easily get distracted at home, making their learning ineffective. This reasoning is plausible, however, in my experience, there are far more distractions at school than at home in isolation. For instance, in my Spanish class, the students were extremely loud and talkative because their was a substitute teacher, which affected me, a student who actually wanted to learn, since my mind could not properly process the information with all the noise in the room. When I got home from school, I worked on the assignment that I couldn't finish in class and was able to do it in only fifteen minutes because I could think more clearly with nothing but the serene silence filling up the room. Furthermore, in AP psychology, I sit next to my best friend Generic_Name, and, despite my best efforts to pay attention in class, I get distracted because the two of us talk and goof around, whereas, at home, I can concentrate on my work for hours when I am alone. Overall, distractions like friends and disruptive classmates can make learning in school difficult, so taking class from home in isolation may be even more effective than physically being in school.

To conclude, students can reap many benefits from online classes that would facilitate their growth both in and out of school. Attending class online gives the student control of learning in a way that is preferrable to them, which is important because then students will comprehend more and learn effectively, and gives the opportunity to explore interests with the extra time at hand to grow as an individual. It would be an absolute waste of resources if schools failed to take advantage of such technologies that could improve students' education and well-being. Not only is the availability of online classes beneficial to the students, but it is useful in an emergency such as a threat of a school shooting, which is unfortunately a prominent issue and possibility in the modern world, or a viral outbreak. Technology has changed drastically from when the school system was first established and normalized and so has society, so it's imperative that the schools take action to adapt to the changing world, especially now in the wake of a global pandemic. ",6,1621350000000.0,2732,2888,"Some may disagree that students should be able to attend class online because students may easily get distracted at home, making their learning ineffective.

When you make difficult choices, you always want advice before it actually happens. Sometimes people aren't sure of themselves, and they might not think that only one person is trustworthy enough. People talk to more than one person for advice because they want to make a better choice. They want to hear what other people have experienced, their personal feelings about the situation, the pros and cons, how they view everything, so they don't feel anxious about it as much. No one wants to do something when they don't know what will come out of it, and not only one person can help them. Sometimes people just need more assurance before they do something big, and talking to more people helps them a lot more than one person can alone. People talk to more than one person because they want their choice to be the best and most beneficial choice no matter what.

Everyone has lived a different life, whether you were rich or poor, healthy or ill, no one has lived the same life as another. When you need help making a choice, you talk to people because they haven't lived exactly like you. They haven't lived exactly like anyone. I would need to know what other people have spectated or experienced when they have had to make a choice similar to mine because I don't want one person to help. I want more people to help advise me because they might have experienced more than I have. You get more wisdom to make your choice when you hear more experiences. They view things differently than someone else. Getting more than one opinion makes sure you don't hear just point of view. It opens your eyes to many other things instead of being one-sided. Everyone has experienced different things in their lives, so not a single opinion alone will be correct. You would need many experiences to truly know what can happen from your choice.

People have anxiety when making hard choices. They always think of all the things that could go wrong in the process. Talking to one person doesn't always help, some people might think their opinion isn't enough. I don't always trust my opinion or my judgment. I need others to make me feel safe and secure, so that I can really trust what I'm doing. I don't want to make a choice when I'm anxious because then I will regret it later. I know I wouldn't be in the right mindset to make a choice if I'm anxious, so talking to more than one person would relieve most of my stress and anxiety. If you talk to only one person, you only get one of everything. You don't know everything that might happen, so you don't really know if you're doing the best thing. No one should make a choice when they are not sure about it. They should always feel that their choice was the best that they could have done. When you talk to more than one person, you know more the possible outcomes. You don't think about everything that can go wrong, but instead you think about all the things that you're doing right. You make your choice in the best mindset when you're not anxious.

You always want to know the pros and cons of things, but it is normally hard to find them on your own. Talking to one person doesn't always help because they are also just one person. Putting multiple minds together to think of pros and cons will give spectacular outcomes. Sometimes I need all the facts, pros, and cons. My mind and others needs help to come up with these pros and cons because we have a lot on our minds already about making the decision itself. We would be preparing to actually do it. I know I wouldn't be able to do it all on my own. I know I would need multiple people to help me because sometimes people aren't feeling their best. They might not be able to help you find all the pros and cons, but bringing together multiple people ensures that you get the facts you want. I wouldn't want to make a choice without knowing the cons of it. I want to know all the bad things that might happen even if it's for the best so that I can prepare for it. You would also get more detailed and possibly more profound pros and cons. You get all the facts when you work with more people, because more minds means more knowledge.

Everyone needs a support system, whether it's family or friends. When you ask for advice, you go to multiple people for help. You ask them for things to help you make your choice. I want people behind me to help me after I make my choice. If the choice knocks me down in any way, I want people to be there to support me. If I talk to multiple people, I know all of those people will help me if I fall. No one wants to feel alone after their choice. I would only make a tough choice if I was certain I had at least one person to help me. If I talked to more than one person, I know at least one of them will be able to support me because they helped me. They know what I was going through when I was making this choice. Talking to more than one person ensures that you have at least one person to fall back on after you made your choice.

No one knows if they're doing the right thing. Sometimes they don't trust them self, sometimes they're too anxious, and sometimes they just need more people to support them. Talking to more people helps you make the best choice. You know what you're doing is for the best. You know that you heard what might happen, you've seen things through other points of view, you aren't anxious when you make your choice, and you know people have your back. Talking to more people helps you make a better choice because no one can do everything alone. If you talk to more people, you trust them and yourself even more. You know what you're up against and you know what will come out of it. Asking more than one person for advice does wonders for you.

After you talk to people you trust, you know what you're doing is the best you can do, and you know that your choice gives you the best outcome possible.                    ",6,1617920000000.0,1733,1918,"Everyone has experienced different things in their lives, so not a single opinion alone will be correct.

Instead of voting to choose electors to vote for the next president, popular votes seem more accurate , because it shows what president is more popular or wanted by the people.

To add on, electoral college votes not for the president, but for a slate of electors, states source 2. The electors are people not holding public office, which no one wants to vote for electors, the whole point is just to vote for the next president to serve and help maintain our country. Electoral College votes can be confusing also because voters may sometimes vote for the wrong canidate which is another problem if that person wasn't really voted for in the right mindset. To conclude, most people believe that electoral votes are unfair and in my opinion shouldn't be continued.

On the other hand, some people might agree to the idea of electoral college votes, it has certainty of outcome and sometimes the electoral college votes excede the popular votes , which gaurentee the win of the president elected. In toss-up states however, voters tend to pay more attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing canidates. So in toss-up states, thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election but electoral college votes don't necessarily let that happen. Lastly , electoral votes are kind of a good thing because it avoids the problem of elections where no canidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. With electoral votes, we avoid the problem of run-off elections and by doing so , the electoral votes help clear a winner.

In conclusion, the thought of electoral college votes all relys on someones opinion. If more people dislike the idea of the electoral college vote , then maybe it could be changed to popular vote only. In some peoples opinions, using electoral college votes are somewhat useless because most people who vote, their votes won't count , which makes the whole voting process pointless since everyone doesn't get a say in what president they should be able to have to help bring out and set forth their ideas. But popular vote allows that freedom of voting for the most wanted president, not the president picked only because electors wanted them. Voting is all based on the perspective of all people which is why electoral college votes should be changed to election by popular vote only.

Like if you do something that you dont think is right you might want to ask a few different people if they think it wrong or not but some advice differ between other people. But you dont have to fall in others footsteps you can live your own life and be yourself. Also you should never do things that other people tell you to do if you think it's wrong or if they think it's right.

Also you should only listen to your family if you need advice for when you were young but when you get older you should only listen to your family and the friends you truly trust. Instead of you trusting someone you just met like a few years ago. When you go up to someone and ask them for advice be sure to greet them instead of just going up to them and just straight up asking them for advice when you should get to know them a little more. Say if you were going to your grandparents house and you had a secret that you kept away from you family but a few days ago you told you parents and they werent mad but the didn't like you keeping a secret away from them for that long. So then they take you to your grandparents house and you tell them the whole story and you ask them for advice and the tell you to sit down and talk to them.

So taking advice from people isnt always bad but if you take advice from bad people the will give you bad advice on different things like if you ask a prisoner on advice for schoolwork they might just say dont do it it wont help you in the long run. Also different people have different personalities like bad people who have gotten arrested compared to people that work for the state police and people that work for the state or national government. All in all I think that you should go to multiple people for advice on different things like driving a car I think that you should go to as many people as you can when you first start to drive so you know a little bit about how some people act on the road.

In paragraph 2 the author starts out saying how venus is earth's twin and that venus is the closest planet to us in terms of density and size. In the body paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems.

In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus,

NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.

I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth.

Although creating assignments from the inner machinations of the school faculty may seem like an efficient and universal way to get kids learning over break, students would much rather work on and complete an assignment designed by them and their peers in the school.

When students get assigned work to do over their much needed breaks from school, 9/10 students will dread the work and either put it off until the last minute or not do it at all. Most teacher created assignments end up being very demanding from the students and/or being a nuisance as it is often viewed as a disruption of the students' summer vacations, making it seem as though they never left school, merely changed settings. Teacher made assignments are, most of the time, recycled work from previous years and can come across as ""out of date"" in terms of the curriculum and in what the youth of the time may deem worthy of completing over a short period of bliss and no responsibilities. For example, when a teacher assigns an annotation and project on a book that has been read over and over again by the school, students will not be motivated to seek completion of said assignment.

Students designing their own work could very much prove effective in terms of completion rates and motivation for the schools' population to do the work that they have created for themselves. This creates assignments that are doable, fun, relevant, and unique to past work given in previous years, adding a refreshing take on summer work for school that is also a way to promote a longer lasting education. The process of designing summer assignments can, in itself, me made into an assignment and may be used as a teaching moment for both the students and teachers alike. The creativity aspect of truly building an idea from the ground up will boost productivity and will incentivize making a well rounded project for the months away from school. When a student goes from being given a book to read and annotate about the impacts of World War II, to making a short film or presentation about the same topic, the whole assignment goes from a mundane and time wasting chore, to a fun and creative way to express the same idea as the former assignment.

Having a student designed summer assignment would be very beneficial to the students' learning experience and may help boost morale within the school for appier kids and a less stressful summer break. In the end, it makes a lot of sense to put students in charge of designing their own projects because at the end of the day, they are going to be the ones completing them and in turn benefiting from the work put being into it. ",4,1618850000000.0,1499,1689,Students designing their own work could very much prove effective in terms of completion rates and motivation for the schools' population to do the work that they have created for themselves ,Evidence,Evidence 2,Effective,1618850000000.0,"This creates assignments that are doable, fun, relevant, and unique to past work given in previous years, adding a refreshing take on summer work for school that is also a way to promote a longer lasting education.",Claim,Virginia,Independent,,Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

151318,AAAXMP138200001519942125_OR,E974D272C14E,train,"Discussion among my classmates and teachers regarding online learning has been circulating throughout my school. Many of my peers and teachers have opposing views on the matter. Some students say that it would be easier, and that it would be amazing if we didn't have to be stuck in a classroom all day and sit through a lecture. While, my teachers state it would be much more challenging to teach the material, and for students to obtain it. I do not think that online learning would be beneficial towards students because it diminishes students' creativity, is not realistic in everyday life, and would be unsuccessful due to teenagers lack of motivation.

Creativity should play a key role in a students growth throughout their education. Without being in the classroom, ways to express one's creativity would be limited. Projects, presentations and intellectual conversations would be removed from the learning realm, and would be replaced with watching videos and staring at a computer all day. Technology has been proven to be unhealthy to adults and especially teenagers. It has rotted our brains, shortened our attention span, and removed our creativity. Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day. If we were to take online classes from home we would be constantly hovered over our computer screens, diminishing our creativity and forgetting what school used to mean.

Online school is not realistic and does not help teenagers prepare for the real world. With online school there would be few, if not any, interaction between peers or with adults. Teenagers today can barley talk to an adult without looking at their feet and avoiding eye-contact, due to the lessening of interaction in the classrooms. Online learning would only increase the problem. Most jobs across the country and throughout the rest of the world all have a form of interaction whether it is presenting a presentation, discussion in meetings, business calls, marketing, and much more. Students would be ill-prepared to step into the real world and be successful in their next step of life. Life is not seen through a computer screen and nor should it ever. While technology can be practical at times, it should not be what students rely on for their education.

Teenagers lack of motivation would lead to the unproductive reality of online school. Most teenagers do not have the discipline, or attention span to take time out of their day, everyday, to sit down at home for hours on end and learn online. Most teenagers need discipline in the classroom. When in school, if students get off track their is a teacher there to help them focus and be productive. When sitting in a desk at school, teenagers are much more productive then if they were to lay in bed at home watching videos. If one were to take online classes at home they would no longer face the discipline teachers show them everyday in school when saying, ""put your phone away!"" or ""stop talking!"" or ""wake up!"". Without teachers to help guide them in the classroom, majority of students would be on their phones, sleep, or be with their friends all day.

Overall, online learning would be ill-fitting for my generation and others to come because it destroys creativity, does not help one in the real world, and would be difficult for teenagers due to their lack of motivation. While, some may see it as a new and improved way for students to learn, be independent, and serve as a convenience; the negatives out way the positives in too many ways, especially the health of adolescent teenagers.",5,1621280000000.0,2802,2862,"it should not be what students rely on for their education.

I think its not fair to students that don't want to do community service should be forced too. It should be a choice not something we have to do. Some students like helping out and being kind others do not want to waste their time helping or be responsible that is on them not on you. It would be different if the students were making a mess and trashing the school on purpose then they should do community service but some kids are busy or do not have the time to help out. Some kids do it because they have nothing better to do. I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't like to be forced to do something you really don't want to do. please just think about it. For the kids that do community service should get a little something from you or the school it doesn't have to be anything expensive just a thanks or a pencil or something to show the you appreciate their kindness. You can ask students to help out with things or show others how to do something. You will have more students help out if they are asked but if they are forced most wouldn't bother doing it. Ask any student for help no matter if they say yes or no it doesn't hurt to ask someone for their help.

Or you can put papers on the schools boards about things that are needed to be helped with. Put it places where students can see it. Its easier that way if you are very busy to ask students around the school just put the papers up and wait for students to show up to your office ether asking where to go or they just might find out by themselves and do what they were asked to do. Who knows if the trouble makers might want to help out and do good. I don't recommend you to make this official yet ask other students what do they think about this and ask if it would be better to have it by choice.

106330,5353483,605DDEFB7A40,train,"The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something.

When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.

As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.

In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.

Yes, It is possible that the outcome of the popular vote that the people have chosen is not in agreement but it has been the best way of selecting a President. It is highly unlikely that when the people vote for certain selection of the candidates group of electors will change their mind. It has happened before but It's rare. I suggest that the electoral college stay, and not change the election because It has not only been used for years, but also some of the citizens may make a mistake in who they vote for, and atleast with the Electoral College we can make sure we have the right President.

Each Candidate has their own electors and it take 270 of electoral votes to choose a President and since they are from the same group, they wouldn't choose someone else. It has happened in 2000, as it says in the excerpt. This system has been used for years, why change it now. The Electoral Collge has worked this way for years, the founding fathers came up with it as a good process. It is completely fair to all. The people get to select their candidate and the electors know what their responsibilities are. The citizens aren't completely able to control the electors ideas but they might have a bit more knowledge on the subject.

'Some citizens may get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate' excerpt from passge. This refers to the fact that we may have chaos if we let the people decide directly who is our President. We need an insider to review our peoples choices and make sure that it is the correct one, and what better way than to have the Electoral College do it. It depends on the state and the candiddate's political party, In which you chose. The People will get what they asked for, their has been times In which it that is not always the case, but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for.

As said in the passage ""In defense of the Electoral Collage"", Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and the trust is rarely betrayed, This system is the best one yet. Our people are well informed but not always, If we take out the Electoral college, we are leaving our country in their hands and people make mistakes sometimes, with the electoral college we have various people making the right decision.

It's like when an author writes a book, they don't get it published right away, they have people to make sure their spelling is correct and they make many other different corrections. It's the same with the Electoral college and the way the president is selected. As my state senator, I suggest we keep this system.

People have bias opinions on certain topics for many different reasons. Being bias means that you feel strongly about one side of something. For example, Republicans and Democrats, most people that are very into politics are normally bias about the side that they are supporting. Some reasons why people are bias is because of the way they were raised or maybe the reason is where they were born. Whatever the reason is, people can be very bias.

Some people aren't very educated on certain topics depending on if they actually care or pay attention to the topic. For example, some people really get into politics, pay a lot of attention to it, stay updated, and talk about it a lot. On the other hand some people don't really get into it very much and don't pay to much attention to it. It really all just depends on how the person truly feels about it, and how important the person thinks it is.

Asking for other peoples opinions about a certain topic is a good way to get to know more about both sides, and learn how and why they feel about certain things. Some people might feel one way about something, and another person feels the exact opposite then how the other person feels. In that case, you get to hear and learn about how both sides feel, and why they exactly they feel that away about the topic. It's good to hear both sides because your opinion might completely change, or maybe you'll begin to start having a more neutral opinion about the topic.

I agree because students move around when playing sports. Most students that play in a team could play the sports that they like. You can start feeling healthy after a game of any sport, and students can enjoy the nature when there outside. Students can help out with yearbooks, as a result they can design the front cover of the year book. Lots of students like art work from the front cover and will want a yearbook. Students can serve on students council which helps other students with disorders. They will be appreciated in what they are doing for others and the rest of the students will be happy.

Some students may have other activities to do after-school, and cannot find time for other activities.

Other students may think it is a great idea and have an astronomically amount of extra time to do extra-school activities.

There is no compensation for that because every student must participate in something, so for that reason, students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity, and there are several other reasons why.

Students have many other hobbies and don't have time to go to any of the extracurricular activities.

Other students have work, and cannot get time off, before or after school for the activities, which puts them at a huge disadvantage.

Many teenagers have all around season sports outside of school which provides no stable insurance of time with other activities.

Students may feel forced and not want to partake in any of the activities.

Students may feel an unwanted attitude and feeling from some extracurricular groups.

Students may have a grim the teacher of council of the group, because he is not good enough, or does not have enough experience.

The teachers may be negligent and not notice that one particular student is treating kids with more authority while the others kids are being submissive because they are not competent in sports, politics, etc..

Not every single student has a liking or interest to any of the extracurricular activities, and could quite possibly be interested in other activities.

Students may feel obliged and wanting to participate in activities, but are not going to because his/her friends don't want to dont want to indulge in that specific activity.

That may possibly discourage some students and could result in no participation at all.

Also, the student's parents may not allow participation in some particular activities because there might be a risk of getting injured in some sports, or their past experience with doing an activity that could prohibit participation in that activity.

Students could be stressed out from taking very difficult classes, and might just want to rest after facing conundrum questions on a science lab report, or calculus questions.

In conclusion, I do not agree or sanction with the principal's idea of having student's participate in one or more extracurricular activities.

With students having to do other things outside of school, they cannot make room for another extracurricular activity.

Also, students may feel unwanted because of the lack of experience they might have from the activity that they're doing just to tag along with his/her friends.

Overall, the idea of forcing students into an activity that they might not want to do, is very bad and may force the students into a bad attitude or bad habit.

158258,AAAXMP138200002150182810_OR,B5CC94F03E06,train,"Would talking to more than one person for advice be better or worse? People sometimes need advice for real life problems. It may be because someone are confused about somethings or all around are lost. Some people to have those conversations to release all the pain that is surrounding their life. I think talking to more than one person would be a great idea if you are lost or do not understand things in your life. If you were to talk to more than one person chances are they might have went through what you are going through. Do not go to someone who you do not know nor trust go to someone who really knows you. It is better that way because different people who you do not know have different views on things and opinions but if they are one of your trusted adults or friends you will most likely have the same opinions and if they do not know you they will say whatever. I think that seeking advice from multiple people is a very good idea but YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE you know these people It is also great way to express your feelings and open up about your situation to these multiple people.

First, you need to understand why going to multiple people is a good idea. You can learn a lot not just about yourself but about the person you are getting advice from. Maybe your parents are having a divorce and you go to your friend for advice on how to deal with that and he or she explains that their parents divorces and how they dealt with that. You can get yourself to tell other people your full story because sometimes you might be embarrassed by your story but telling them the whole story would be beneficial and by doing that you can get better advice because the person you go to are fully understanding what is actually happening and you can receive a better response on what to do. You will be getting different opinions on how to deal with things but I think this is a good thing because you choose which outcome you want. When you go to get advice what that means in my head is your looking for different opinions on things because you cannot think about what to do. It is important you do not go to someone who does not know you. You will also be asked different questions by these multiple people so you can articulate your point better.

Next, you 100 percent have to know why you CANNOT go to people who do not know you. The reason why I urge you to not to do this is because if you go to someone you do not know or you do not consider a friend or just someone you do not know at all they will probably tell you something that is irrelevant to what you need to know, they will probably not take you serious and tell you a joke or mess around with you and will probably tell all of their friends your business because in their heads their like I do not know him nor do I care about you so why are you telling me your business. That is why it is important to tell a trusted adult or a friend or just someone who understands you and will not joke around with your problems. It best advised that you go to people you also understand so you both can relate on things during the conversation.

Finally, you have to know that going to other people can make you choose a better choice. People can change your mind they can change how you think in 1 conversation they can make you choose the better choice talking to multiple people can effect how you think. I saw this video that had a girl so deep into wanting to kill herself. She was at a party and she hit her head on a pole going outside and went unconscious quickly and the people at the party brought out their phones and recorded her unconscious and the next day on Monday everyone was looking at her and laughing the whole school had the video after that she was called name for weeks and she wanted to end it. Until she started talking to the teachers about how she wanted to end it but enough conversations from the teachers and principal and her family members got her to convince herself that she should not. I think talking to multiple people can change how you think and they can give you multiple opinions and ideas on what to do and that is why I truly think talking to multiply people for advice is a great way to express feelings or let your pain out. Getting multiple opinions from different people can lead to your opinion being changed.

In conclusion, seeking advice is a great way to express your feelings or deal with something you cannot handle it is better to tell multiple people something than to keep it to yourself because you do not know they might have went through what your going through or maybe even going through it too. Whatever you are going through will just get worse if you keep it to yourself and not tell anyone about your situation you need to understand the things you are doing by not telling someone and by telling multiple people your response will be way better than if you only told one person. When you talk to someone for advice make sure it is not one person. Also by telling multiple people or explaining they will all probably react in different ways. I Believe that talking to multiple people has a great effect on how you think and the choices you make. It is good that you take that chance and get explanations, stories, and background history from the people you are getting advice from because they will probably tell you what to do or what they did when they were in your situation which is exactly why it is better to get advice from multiple people.",5,1617720000000.0,3116,4230,you have to know that going to other people can make you choose a better choice.

If a student is confused or needs help they can simply ask for it, theres no need for a computer to tell what they need help with.

When some people are working on assignments on they often use trial and error and sometimes they just need to think about the problem before they do it. This could get confusing for the computer because when your thinking you often will look confused or you might be confused but later figure it out. You shouldnt have to rely on a computer to tell how your feeling to get help. Dr. Huang said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, Like an effective human instructor."" This ay sound like a good idea but if a student is getting bored they dont need there lesson modified to help them and most kids are going to be bored during school thats just how the majority of students are.

One thing that would be extremly hard to control would be when kids make weird or strange faces. How will a computer distinguish between an emotion due to the lesson and emotion due to something else. Like when a student is talkling to there friend and they laugh or smile. A student could also try to look bored or confused on purpose just to get out of doing certain work. Another big issue is the fact that not every students facial features are the same. One students face could look way different from the faces that the software the computer was built to recognize.

The last reason as to why this wont be a very popular tool in classrooms is because most school computers dont have cameras and wont be able to afford them or the software needed to run the programe. Of course they could get special fuding for the equipment but theres way better things that money could go towards to help the students excel in more ways then on a computer.

Its a very interesting idea but theres just way to many issues involved with it that wont allow it to takwe off like they invision.

106606,5152908,446CB94BD577,train,"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided  the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced relegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definate winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winner-take-all"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.

Distance Learning

Distance learning is a way for students to take classes at home online. There are many benefits for having this option for students. There are many benefits can help from not being overwhelmed, students can go at there own pace, can do other responsibly. For example regular school that you attend in person for some people can be too over whelming, they can still get a education but in a more conferrable environment. In relation to that students can take theyre time and not feel like they are being rushed, and being left behind. Students can go in there own pace whether that being fast or slow they can take there time so they dont rush, and actually learn the content. Lastly school takes up a lot of hours in the day, and some students have other responsibly and, or jobs they have to do. They might have to help out there family with various thing, or having enough money to be able to leave the house when they come of age. Distance learning weather being online or video chat can, be very beneficial and help relieve stress in students.

School of any kind can be overwhelming for some people, like the work load or the time given to gets things done. Some students can get over stimulated and overwhelmed in a regular school environment weather it being people , smells, or noise. Online school can help benefit these students by being in a more comfy, relaxing, or well known environment can can over all preform better. Some might say that these thing are good and will help prepare for life. In some cases this could be the case, but more than likely there are many jobs and options that don't overwhelm or over stimulate place. So distance or online school can greatly impact students to do better, because they are not in a environment that will over stimulate them, and in turn being able to learn better.

School that you have to go to in person has a lot of deadlines whether that be a project or homework. With online school or distance learning you would still have deadlines , yes , but you can go the speed most constable with you that either being fast or school. For some students when they feel rushed or is out of time to do a task, this can lead to sloppy, rushed, messy work. If students are not given enough time to complete a assignment or task they just might not get the work done or turn something in sloppy, half finished just too get a grade. With distance learning students can go the speed that they need to go that is better suited with them, and over all produce better work.

For many students, school is the not the only thing they have to do they might have a job, responsibly at home, or personal stuff to take care of. With distance learning it has more flexible schedule and being able to get more done in a day. Some might say that school comes first before anything else but for some this is not the case , many might be able to come have other responsibly that are more important than school and other things. Being able to do online school students can basically do it any where as long as they have WIFI, so this would free up time for students to do the other tasks they need to do. In person school can take up a lot of hours in the day where some might have to look after there family or get a job to earn money to move out. Online school can work better for some people because of there flexible schedule, but still getting a education while taking care of there needs.

Online school or distance learning can be very beneficial for the students who need it. It should be a option if students if they need it, because you never know a persons situation. The benefits of not being overwhelmed , students going at there own pace, and taking care of other responsibly. Having this as a option in our school will help student who ever wants it. There will still be regular, in person school if that works better with them, then do that. Having more options on how students learn can greatly help, not every one learns the same way so having options in important.",5,1621020000000.0,0,48,"Generic_Name

Many may say that using cellphones while driving is dangerous and that the shouldn't be used while driving, but actually there are more pros than cons. You have apps now that let you use your phone while driving without actually touching your phone. Its pure fact that if not many but all teens that are in school and driving stress about school, life, etc. With students and people in general stressing, They may lead to hit and runs and cameras on phones can clearly help identify or capture the drivers or their licenses plate.

While many may complain about how driving while using your phone is dangerous and this and that, they probably have been living under a rock for the past couple of years because there has been this new feature that has been around for a couple years now it called ,hands-free feature. It lets you do about everything you would be capable of doing if you were actually touching and your phone. On the website ""drivingschool. net"", they stated that ""a hands free mobile phone can minimize such issue, allowing driver to make calls without taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the wheel.""

Hit and Run drivers do exist. On the website ""newsroom. aaa. com"" they claimed that,"" Hit-and-Runs deaths in the US have increased an average of 7.2 percent each year since 2009."" The cameras on phones allow for drivers to take pictures of license plate numbers. In the past year its been reported that the percentage from 8% to 12% and those where from how many Hit-and-Runs where caught in only 2019.

Yes, although many people have stated that teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones its also proven that using phones while driving driving may be beneficial. People love to complaining and talk about how teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones but they always bring up the irresponsible one or the more reckless ones as an example. There are people that drive perfectly fine and are capable of using their phones that exist. Many people don't like bringing those type of people up because they want to make a point.

As i've been stating now this entire time, yes using your phone while driving may be beneficial but its also dangerous. So im not stating that you need to starting doing it always just when neccessary . Using your phone while driving may be useful but remember your safety comes first.

Venus is a planet that most people think are a star because of how brightly it shines at night which makes it very noticeable. Not many other things are known about Venus: Not many people think about exploring Venus when they think of space exploration. In the article the author talks about both the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibility for the future.

The author states that Venus is ""often referred to as Earth's 'twin'"" because out of all the planets Venus has a similar density and size compared to Earth. The terrain of Venus is also very similar to the terrain of Earth. They both have landmarks that are similar ""to familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This evidence shows how the landscape of Venus has the possibility to be a home for humans. The similarities between Earth and Venus make Venus a valuable place to explore in greater depth.

Although Venus has a similar terrain to Earth, the ground climate is too rough for anyone to safely land in Venus. Venus has a temperature that humans can not survive in, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also on Venus the pressure is 90 times what humans experience on Earth. Humans have never experienced conditions as extreme as those on Venus: ""Even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of [the] oceans"" would be crushed and the high temperatures ""would liquefy many metals."" Something that was made to be able to go withstand high pressures, like a submarine, would be crushed on Venus, and metals can withstand very high temperatures but on venus they would liqeufy. It is unsafe and humanly impossible for humans to try to explore the land of Venus when some of the best technology can not even withstand the climate of Venus.

As of now there is not enough technology for humans to explore Venus on the surface, but they can explore Venus from above. It is a possibility for scientists to hover 30 miles above Venus. This way the scientists will not have to experience the total wrath of Venus's surface, but they would experince ""temperatures that would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, [and] the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Humans can live in those conditions, even though they may not be ideal. Scientists would be able to explore Venus without putting them at risk. There is still not technology for the scientists to throughly explore Venus the way they want to. They would only get a glimpse into what Venus is like. New inivations are being worked on that can withstand Venus's tumultous surface, so that scientists can get the full picture of

Venus.

Venus has great potential for exploration, but with that great potential comes great risk. The author of the article talks about the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibilty for the future. Venus is very similar to Earth in the terrain that they both have, but the surface conditions of Venus are deadly to humans.

I think it would actually be better for people 18. If you are 18 it gives you more free time to get a full time good paying job and you will still be able to go to school. It is not as hard on your body as going to school either, saying that meaning when you work and you go to school most days you would have to leave school and go straight to work. With online classes you can wake up for class do your work an when you finish you can go back to sleep until its time for you to go to work. Believe it or not you have more time to do your class work to, you can do it before you go to work or as soon it is given to you. You just have to know how to manage your time right and wanna do good in school and maintain a steady job.

Taking online classes really gives you a lot of free time you just have to know what to do with it. If it was me who had a chance to take only online classes. I would get me a full time job some where and I would do both. when I say that I know it sounds stressful and hard to do but when you really put thought into it you would have time to do them both. Say if I was working over night I could wake up around Noon I could do my work and then I could go back to sleep and rest more before I go to work. I could really picture that working out.

If someone is to try this with online classes it world be easier on their body because, you dont have to wake up and go to school and stay up all day and then go to work you can rest a little more before you go to work. Then you are not gonna be tired at work you can come home and sleep and then you dont have to wake up early after you get off of work late. You may not know it but rest is a big thing I never understood that until I got a job an now that I am not getting that much sleep I realized that your body needs rest because without rest your body is not right until you get the rest you need.

The good part about the whole thing is that you will have a lot more time to do your classwork. I am not talking about a hour of class time im talking about you can sit down and finish all of your work at your own pace you will get much more done in less time and you will still have more free time. you will still be able to enjoy yourself on your days off with no school work or if you have some you have not done you can do it on your days you have off. Honestly its a lot of ways you can go about having online classes a lot of people can have a lot of different ways to look at this but this is just the way I look at it. If i was to ever get the chance to do online classes I would take this route and try to maintain a job and school at the same time i am not really sure why this is just how I would go about it.

In conclusion if you are in high school an they offer online classes for people almost done with school take them up on that because it would push you harder to graduate letting you know that your almost there. some people might thing school is easier but everyone opinion is different. My opinion would be what i talked about in my paper which is to take the online classes an get you a job so therefore you could work and make money while you not in school. And if thats not what you want to do just fine something out in the world productive to do for the time you are taking those online classes.

It also can help students get out of there shy zone and do something they like or enjoy, and just be themselves. I agree that all students should have to participate in at least one activity like the yearbook, helping teachers, and sports.

One activity they could do is help teachers with students. When a teacher is teaching and some students are having a hard time understanding the lesson they can help there class mates, since it's only one teacher and about twenty students. The teacher can't help everybody at one time so one student can be their little helper. So if one student understand the lesson then they can help the teacher with the other students. Also they can help grade papers with the teacher. So the students can get there paper back faster and see if they were successful or if they need more practice and studying time. So like if they got a 60% on there test then they know they can stay after school and get extra help so they can pass next time. One more thing is students are scared to ask questions because they think people will mess with them for getting help, so they just stay quiet and not get the help they need.

Another activity they could participate in is the yearbook club. The yearbook is like an important thing in school because it holds all the amazing memories that happen throughout the school year. What makes it fun is the students can go all around the school and take pictures. Also they can decorate the book and make is enjoyable for others. When students are participating in the yearbook it means they can make new friends and be be more active. If the students get caught in school taking pictures all the time, then ask them if they want to be apart of the yearbook club and they can take pictures all they want and not get in trouble. The yearbook club should be a place the students can be free, have fun, and not have to have a teacher yelling at them all the time for something small.

One final thing student's can participate in is sports. Some students love sports but scared to try out because they think their not good enough for the team, so they just sit back and stay quiet or d nothing. If sports is something students' like to do then they should do it if it's basketball. football, soccer, or anything else then do it. Students have the right to do what they want without having to be asked or blackmailed. Like if a student is in GYM class and not doing anything then out of nowhere the coach says ""if you don't participate in the game then i'm calling your parents"". So let the students choose when they are going to join in a game. If some students want to play soccer but the others want to play basketball, then have one side of the court basketball and the other soccer. So they all can do what they like and have fun.

I agree that student's should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as the yearbook club, helping the teacher, and sports.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars in search for a landing spot for its sister ship. During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.

The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..."" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.

Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.

Students will have more time to learn while, they are attendin their classes in home because they wil get enough time to study , to finish their homework or assignment because the have time that helps them to have to get good grade. For instance, I attended some clasese in online like; Computer Intro that helped me to hearn more about computer and helps to get some some information about how to write fast and the teacher gives me information about typing club that helps me to write quickly. Attending online classes gives alot of information like: how to research, what to look, and how to take notes it's helps to get more enough time to learn.

Also, it helps to save your time because many young teeneger works while they are in school. For-example, my friends start working while she is sixteen because she wants to save many to collage and to help herself. If, students taking online classes that helps to save their time because students who is working while in high school some students working after school and they going sleep late that distarcted to not give attension to the classes , but if students are taking online classes that would help to have time to review and it helps pay atttension well. It helps them to do well in skills by learning also it helps to by finiacal.

Aluthough, many of said taking online classes in home has disadantage because students get easly distarcted and can't improve themselves.

Students will get easy distarcted if, they are taking online or video while they are in home beacuse they can get ealy distarcted by social media like: Facebook, Indtagram or Snapchat because of most teeneger spend time to socia media that doesn't help them to do well in classes also, they can't get improve themselves because they can get alot of free time that doesn't help students to be succseful , however the teacher will give the students assignment, test, and homework while they attend the classes the teacher know how the students doing that helps the students to keep the track. Also, the teachers have the students parenting email when students first register that helps to keep students by paranting eyes. The teachers will send email to parents when they have test result , so parents will see how his/her children doing in the classes.

In summary, students can get good grades and they can improve knowledge while they are home taking by online classes.                                                                                                              ",3,1621770000000.0,1430,1567,"Aluthough, many of said taking online classes in home has disadantage because students get easly distarcted and can't improve themselves.

128932,2021007165,199980ADEC34,train,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that Policy 1 is better.

I believe that this policy is better because; one, it gives the students to have a ""free"" time and to be able to get their minds off all of their school work and it gives them a chance to communicate with other people, and two, I believe that having a cell phone out during a lunch period does not interfere with how the students learn.

Policy 1 would let the students have more freedom then they would normally have and I believe that when students get to have freedoms, like this one, they will behave better because they will not be trying to sneak and check their phone during their class period.

Whenever I see a student checking their phone during class time, it does distract me and I believe that if students would be able to use their cell phones during other times throughout the school day, then they would be less likely to try to use their phone during class.

Policy 2 doesn't let the students have any freedoms with their cell phones, and when students know that they don't have any privileges with their phones, they try to get away without anyone noticing them using it.

Although most students listen to the policies when it comes to their cell phones, some just don't.

Most of the students listen because they either don't want to get their phone taken away, or they don't care that they can't use their phones during the school day.

Then, other students don't care if they do or don't get caught using it.

I would like you to consider my thoughts and ideas about the cell phone usage during the school day and maybe also consider changing the policy.

Then the sensors for the cars I know will take weeks to put all of them in to properly work. Also how is it suppose to be a smart car when you still have to hold the wheel at all times. Although it might have some positives about the car, it still has a numerous number of negitives such as: if the driverless car goes to fast do you get a ticket and have to pay or what is the consequences.

First and foremost, the sensors on the smart cars. It must take a fortune to buy and apply every single little sensor thats need daily on the rode. Plus it must take alot of people to do that and you have to pay them a lot as well so that means you're going to spend so much money that you're going to try and sell it for a huge price of change that no one has to spend. Or the timing, it probably take one/fourth of the time it take to make that robot car.

Moreover, you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. What if you're taking a rode trip and you want to get some rest, you can't because your handle has to be positioned on the wheel at all times. Also if you have a important meating and you are trying to finish up your presentation,you can't. Eventhough it might do some incredible things but it aslo can mouth-function and leave you stranded.

Equally important, what about the laws for the car.

154257,AAAXMP138200001639032810_OR,7A56F29D9707,train,"Have you ever asked more than one person for a solution to your problem? Were there millions of thoughts swimming through your mind about how you could solve the problem you were in, or how you got yourself into that position in the first place? It's normal, everyone has been in those types of situation before. It's a common thing for someone to ask more than one person for advice. Usually, because the person they are asking is more wiser and knowledgeable than them, or they are trying to find the best answer, or even to know the mistake they are about to make. Let me break it down for you.

First, a person might ask more than one person for advice because they want the best answer. People like to find the easy way out of things and to not think too had about something, because they can get overwhelmed. For example, a middle schooler named ""Generic_Name,"" was just told a big secret from her friend ""Generic_Name."" Generic_Name wanted to hurt himself, and he had only told Generic_Name about it. He had also told her that she can't tell anyone about the secret. Generic_Name doesn't want Generic_Name to hurt himself, and she wants to tell someone. But, Chis told her to not do that. Generic_Name got hit in the face by thousands of emotions and got really worried about her friend. When Generic_Name came home from school, she told her brother about the situation, her brother said,"" if Generic_Name wants to hurt himself, then let him do it."" Generic_Name didn't think that was a good answer. So, she went to her mother who said, ""maybe you should tell his parents about it."" Generic_Name didn't like that answer a whole lot either. Finally, she went to her father who said, "" you need to help Generic_Name out by telling him all the good things about life and help him be happy, maybe change his mind."" Out of all the answers Generic_Name got, she choose her dad's answer, because it was the best out of all of them. A person will ask others for the best answer or advise, because they think their answer is a bad one and can turn into them making a mistake.

Next, a reason why others will want to get advise from other people, is because they don't like the answer that they came up with in their head, they want to know what others think about their solution, or if they are making a bad choice. For example, a 5th grader named ""Generic_Name"" wants to cheat on a test that he didn't study for. He thinks its a great plan, but he wants to know what his parents will think about it. At dinner, he tells his parents about his plan on cheating on the test. His dad said, "" you shouldn't do that, or you will get in a lot of trouble. Plus, you won't get a good grade. Also, you will have to take the test again."" His mother nodded in agreement. The 5th grader was glad he didn't cheat off the test, because he would have made a big mistake. He is relived to have people who are wiser then him proofread his answers to his problems. Lots of people like talking about their problems to people who are more wiser and experienced then them.

Finally, someone might asked others for advice to help solve their problem, because the people they are asking might be more knowledgeable, or have better common sense then them. Most people say that your brain doesn't fully developed until your in your 20's, so asking others who are more experienced than you is a good thing. Let me give you a thought, you want to get this action figure that is super rare, and theres only 2 of that specific one you want left in the world! All the owner needs is your credit card number, house and ZIP code address, and a copy of your birth certificate. You have this weird feeling about the situation, so you call your uncle about it, who is a mastermind on these types of action figures. You call your uncle and tell him about the figure and that theres only two left in the world, but the owner of the action figure needs all this personal data from you in order to have it shipped. Your uncle says that you shouldn't go for the deal because its a scam. He also says, that no company is going to need that much information from you to buy something. After your done with the call, you felt overjoyed that you had talked to your uncle about the whole thing, because you could of gotten into a lot of trouble.

Overall, it is a good that a person likes to seek advice from others about a problem they are in, it can save them from getting in to trouble or getting in the middle of something wild. Talking to someone who is wiser than you is a fantastic option, so is looking for the best answer out of the ones you got. Even knowing the mistakes you might of made is a good thing.

Those are just some of the many reasons I believe how students can benefit from online school.

Some people believe that kids do not benefit from online school, for example, the kids can't get actual help from a teacher who is normally present during regular school. This is important because some kids learn differelntly than others and may need that extra help from a teacher but some online courses may not have that option.

Online school can be very beneficial for students in high school and college students who have jobs to where they cant attend school for a full day, for instance, I have a friend who gets paid to play video games and so he does his school online and he can complete it at his conveinience and still get a degree. This is important because it gives the student a chance to learn and be able to accomplish other things at the same time.

Students who have a difficult time keeping up with the work in the classroom can also benefit from online school because they can complete the tasks at their own pace, for example, I have a hard time keeping up with the pace of my math class and believe that if I were to be able to learn the material at my own pace I would be doing a lot better in that class.

Cell phone use while driving statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. According to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk.

Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving.

Parents should also avoid calling their teen when he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination.

In most situations cell phones are the most abused element to cause accidents. Cell phones are a major distraction in the society today. Many people depend on them to get to where they need to go. I believe that the use of cell phones should be banned because they can cause fatal accidents , serious distractions , and the death of many people.

Fatal accidents happen because drivers are paying attention to their cell phones and not on the road. These accidents occur because people aren't able to multitask. They put not only their life in danger but other drivers and pedestrian . Driving needs your full divided attention. People are continuously dying because they lost control of their vehicle from worrying bout their phones. They fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them.

Another reason using cell phones while driving should be banned is because it's a very serious distraction. People pay more attention to their phones than the road. Drivers using their cell phone react slowly and often make wrong decision causing serious accidents involving other vehicles also. When the drivers are distracted they have low chance of reducing performance skills. Having a conscience of the events happening around the vehicle leads to greater impacts on driving.

In conclusion , cell phone usage while driving is a danger zone to yourself and other drivers. Using a cell phone while driving is a factor that leads to a grave.

From their house, their school or work. Phone, laptop, computer, cars, etc. Each day a lot of inventors work hard to produce their invention to make the world better. Recently, iphone company just release a new iphone called iphone X that you can unlock the phone without using your finger, you can just look at the camera and the phone will recognize your face and open it for you. That is a really popular invention that everyone excited to buy and love to use. People create many new technology for it to communicate with humans like iphone X as an example. Thomas Huang professor of University of Illinois collaboration with Nicu Sebe professor of University of Amsterdam created a software called :""Facial Action Coding System."" The software were created because Dr. Huang said that he want to develop better ways for huamsn and computers to communicate. The software can recognize humans emotions. Either, you happy, sad, fear or surprise, the computer just look at you and tell what is your feeling right the way. Because Dr. Huang is a professor at University of Illinois, beside the software he just look like every professior that have to go to class and teach. As many people know, not every time you attend the class you understand what the teacher teach you. Sometime you get bored, sometime you get confused or tired. But all of that emotions you are the only one that know about it. With that in mind, Dr. Huang wanted to bring the software to his class so he will know his lesson is actually go through students mind or not. He will know the time to change the topic to make student more productive, more happy and enjoy in his lesson. Not just only him, every teacher in the world need this sofware, everyone want their students to happy to learn. More happy you are, more focus you are in the class. The Facial Action Coding System is a valuable software for school that help teacher recognize students feeling and that can make the class better.

Here is how it works. According to the article ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles"" This show that, we can believe in the result of the software after its read the emotions. Because the computer created a model of the face, with all muscles that humans has. When you move your face the 3-D model of the face will form exactly the same as your face to help the software recognize what is that emotion. One of psychologist and creator of FACS that work with Dr. Huang is Dr. Paul Eckman has classified there are six basic emotions :""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" That is what emtions of a regular humans looks like. Either you happy because you got good grades, or anger because someone ate you ice cream that you save for a long time. They bring every emotions of humans in real life in the software to help help it easily recognize humans face. One of the example from the article is when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you are surprised, or your orbicularis oris (around your moth) tightens your lips to show anger. The computer is really smart, just look to your face and form the 3-D it can easily show how mad you are, how sad you are. Even from the painting Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci, the computer show she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear ful and 2 percent angry. You can see how smart it is. If you mad and angry or surprise at the same time, the computer will still know and point of the percent of each emotions. When you make a fake smile, the software still recognize it. According to the article ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" You cannot lie to them, they already know exactly how you give them fake or real smile. Go back with Dr. Huang classroom. Why is FACS is a valuable software for study at school? Because when you are tired, bored or mad about something you cannot focus on the lesson or what the teacher or proffessor teach you. From that the computer will recognize your emotions and tell the teacher your feeling. Teacher cannot make you forget about your problems but they will create or find another way to make the class seem more fun or do more activities instead of just standing and read ore teach boring stuff that you don't care about. That's help you feel more comfortable, in that way when you feel happy and relax you can focus on your work more. All of the stuff that you learn will easily come to your brain and you will remember it.

The FACS is a great software for school. It can help teacher/professor a lots in their way of teaching students and from that students will focus more on the teaching time. Not just classroom, this could help many people around the world with whatever they do. Because sometime, humans being never tell anyone about their feeling, they just sad and angry but noone now about it. Using computer to communicate with them is a great ideas. Like an example in the article, when it recognize your emotions and know that you sad, it will find an ad or something funny that can make you laugh right the way. Since many people around the world using technology all the time, people should create more things that could help technology communicate with humans. Because it could help the world more modernized, help the people without family or friends feel better when they communicate with technology. Growth more technology will make the world better.

All of the spacecrafts that have tried to land has never made it back. They have no evidence on what`s on this planet.

Scientist have tried to discover venus but they fail everytime. Do you think it`s because of how thick the atmosphere is with carbon dioxide? The air on Venus is very different that Earth. It makes it difficult because the clouds are filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid and the average temperature is 800 degress Fahrenheit. The human body can not survive in that type of weather.

They may have came up with a idea to float above the fray. They want the vehicle to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and away from the ground. The temperature would still be pretty hot but not as hot as the ground tempertaure. The temperature in the air would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air temperature would be close to the sea level on Earth. As many people study this idea,they will think that the human body would be able to use this method instead of going on the land of Venus. Could you see this happening in the future or not?

Other researchers think that Venus is to inhospitable to visit. They think that many years ago that Venus was just like Earth but they have no evidence to support the claim. On the other hand,how could Venus be like it is today and it like Earth years ago. Did Venus move that far away for it not to be a living place. The planet is a rocky sediment and has valleys,mountains and craters. I would say within a couple of years,scientist will have enough technology to discovert his planet. Would you ever live on this planet if they discover that it is a living place.

With all the evidence and support that scientist have,can Venus be a safe place to live. I think within the next couple years we will truely know what kind of planet it is. Scientist do a good job on studying the planets and any other things they study. I just don`t understand how it was safe man years ago and not anymore. The technology will help us study and get more information we need. I hope to see many people on the Planet Venus in the next couple years.

This is why brick and morder schools will always be a necesity for elementery schoolers, but students outside that age range should have the opportunity to demonstrate their responcibility inorder to receive the privilage of being taught at home rather then at school because of social distractions, and the general time sink that is school .

All you ever hear about public schools today is bullying, exclusion, and drama that is pointless and distracts students from their academics, the solution is right infront of us, online school. Online school would be superior to traditional brick and morter school because students would have minimul opportunities to interact with one and other durring class which would make classroom control easier for the teacher. In adition to students having minimul opportunities to speak in class, everything that was said durring the class could be monitered by the teacher or by an automated program designed to detect any buzz words, unkind or curse words. The audomation could also keep count of the number of times students cursed or said rude things to eachother and report these infractions to the teacher. While this process might sound invasive, it isn't anything that teachers don't try to facilitate with physically, now they can do it technologically.

While the inclass conversations can definently be monitered, there is also out of class social media and txting that could be distracting during online class time, and with no physical adult in the room telling students to put away the phone how could we be sure that we aren't just trading one evil for another? While there are numerous distractions at home that could cause students grades to dip, the solution to this potential problem is that online school would need to be a privilage and not a right. Class time would need to be monitered.

Another benafit of monitered online school is that with less distractions the class could move faster which would allow extra time for students to persue recreational activities, and academic interests- this system would allow students to seperate their work time from their play time in a way that is just not possible today. This system of having extra time to dedicate to passions would also be benafitial in incentivising students to pay attention during class. This system also promotes better friendships by giving students time to persue interests outside of school-- providing an outlet to meet like minded people.

While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that manny students view school as a whole. Instead of being forced to sit in a building all day with other kids, we could be at home leaning on our own time with pre-recorded videos. With online schooling students get the opportunity to control their own edcation, and they are also incentivised to preform well, not because they are compeeting for spots at some perstegeous collage, but becuause they want their own free time.     ",5,1621960000000.0,2595,3094,"While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that manny students view school as a whole.

128045,2221005142,9E0F552B6A65,train,"Dear Ms. Principal:

It has come to my attention as a student, that you may be changing your policies on cell phone use in school. It is my personal opinion that you should allow student to use their phones outside of class. I think this because, myself being a student here, cell phones allow students to contact their families, contact teaching staff, and stay in touch with one another during school hours.

First off, we students are often given difficult projects that we must complete. For example, a group project assigned to two students who don't see each other outside of school hours. Wouldn't it be better for these to students to be able to speak to one another during school hours? This is one of my reasons for supporting the use of cell phones during free time.

Secondly, students may need to contact their families during the day. A student may be a bus rider, but due to bad weather the student may need to be picked up by car. It would be much easier for this student to be able to use their cell phone then to have to borrow one from a teacher or go to the office. Or they may need to tell their mother or father to turn the stove off or let the dog out.

lastly, a student may need to contact a member of the teaching staff for information on a project. Or they may need to ask a question about tonight's homework. Or maybe another student falls and injures themselves, or a fight brakes lose, it would be easy and very convenient to be able to use cell phones in school.

To conclude, the use of cell phones during school would be very beneficial for the student population. I hope I have made you see clearer the benefits of allowing us students to use them.

172115,AAAXMP138200001630322810_OR,C5565E4761B7,train,"Getting multiple peoples advice is helpful because you can get different ideas, different perspectives, and get a chance to use them to cahnge society. Read on to know the truth, if you are intrested.

One way that asking for ideas is because you can get a much wider variety of opinions and ideas. An example of this is that in civics, we do political debates to see who can come up with a better reasoning for their ""party"" on political issues. We do this by splitting into different groups that cover different issues for one major rift in opinions. The topics we have covered so far are gun control and immigration.

Afterwards, we discuss as a group wether we agree or disagree on these opinions. Because of this, whenever someone shows their evidence and reasoning, other people get brand new ideas on how to solve problems. You don't only get new ideas, opinions, and thoughts from talking to people. You might also get social commentary, or a new perspective on things.

Asking other people can give you a new perspective. You could also start seeing life or something different from a new point of view. During the cold war, poeple tried to see the perspective of both sides. The communists wanted a completely free country where everyone has a job and a decent living, but you all ration and get an equal amount of resources. The problem was that this could lead to shortages in supplies, and that people were corrupt in the government. On the other hand, capitalists wanted people to seek their dreams and work hard to get more money, but with more risk and reward. Their issue was that this caused poeple who were lower class to have less of a chance in the world, since you had to compete with the the rich and middle class. Each side had their pros and cons,and both tried to help people. Getting new ideas and perspectives are good, but what about actually using the ideas?

Now that you have heard peoples ideas and opinions, why not actually use them? A group that listened to poeple's ideas was the magnificent Roman Empire, who nearly conquered all of Europe, and the top of Africa. The Romans were always trying to get ahead of their enemies strategically, and technologically. An issue that the Romans had was transporting safe drinking water for their soldiers and civilians. What they did was listen to inventors give their ideas on how to solve this crisis. one inventor gave the great idea of making a device they called an aquaduct. An aquaduct was a long elevated line of stone that acted like an artificial river, because it moved water that could flow into pipes for poeple to get water from, and most importantly, could be spread all across the Roman Empire. Because of the aquaduct having been made, the Romans could keep their troops hydrated, and they did not have to transport gallons of water. This technology is still used in a sense, through the much less glorified sewer. As you can see, getting new ideas is so helpful that it can allow you to advance society!

Overall getting new ideas is very helpful. You can get new views on life that you have not seen before, and apply them to situations. We have also seen that new ideas in the community can even lead to advancing society, and cacn benefit evryone.

In paragraph 3 Heidrun Walter states,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" so an advantage of limiting car usage would be, that you are happier. Vauban in 2006, was an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. Did you know passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intesive areas in the United States. With all that gas from the cars that is just causing more polution. Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessibleto public transportation, with less space for parking. In Vauban they are saying that they want to make walking to a bussiness or shoping center closer so they don't have to walk as far. Another reason why limiting car usage is a good idea, is that if you walk you get exercise which helps your body not just the Earth. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

Wether it be government inforced or not vehicle useage has dropped a staggering amount in the past few years. This new habbit has had many effect on the environment, car industries, and even the way cities are built. What will become of the future if this trend continues?

It says in ""The End of Car Culture"", ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. Therfore if the use of cars decre4ases as it has then carbon emmisions will also decrease along with it and will in turn cause the greenhouse effect to ripidly slow.

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'' The Electoral College is one of the most fair systems our society has set up. This process is fair and essential because it is is not the only determination, each state gets the correct amount of power, and it shows a clear winner.

The Electoral College does is not fully responsible for the outcome of the decision for our President. In the year 2000, this was proved, Gore had received more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. ''It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.'' The section of the nation that believes the Electoral College is unfair believes this because they assume all the power is in this system's hands. Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ''unfair'' picture most perceive is largely mistaken.

The sizes of states in our country widely varies. From Rhode Island to Texas, we have power in Congress. It would simply not be fair if our small states had the same amout of power as our larger states. California has more of a population, therefore should have more say in Congress, than New Jersey. ''Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation; one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.'' Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years. This is only fair to the population of America and equal representation in all the sections of congress would be unfair to the larger states that obviously require and deserve more power than the smaller states in the United States. Basically, power is fairly given to each state under the Electoral College.

''The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.'' Though this situation is rare, in 1968 when Nixon ran against Clinton, both had a total of 43 percent of the popular votes. Yet, because of the Electoral College, a clear winner was shown. If ever in case of this event, this ''pressure'' can complicate and make the choosing of the President way more difficult than it was planned to be. For this reason, our Electoral College sets up a way to take care of this if it was to happen again. Obviously, the Electoral College shows a clear winner and takes out any confusion or problems that could arise.

To conclude, our country is based off of fair rules and systems, one of them being the Electoral College. It is fair because it does not have full power, the right amount of power is applied to each state, and it produces a clear winner.

Many weird, unique, creative landforms are found around Earth that weren't human made, so just because there is a unique landform on Mars we believe aliens formed the landfrom? I believe scientists and other people this to start rumors or just want everyone to believe people say this to get a rise out of every one else. Also, I think they just want it to be big news, ""Aliens are real and we have evidence!"" or something that will get a rise out of everyone.

""Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original Vikings photos. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landfrom. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

That is some evidence that aliens didn't create this landform and that it is just a natural, very unique and creative, landform. Natural landforms are everywhere, even different planets. There are many natural landforms on the moon, but no one says there is aliens living on the moon.

So, I hope this explains to you that aliens did NOT create this landform, it is a natural landform.

The only difference is is that it is on a different planet instead of Earth. I believe that's why everyone thinks aliens created it. Like I said before, natural landforms are everywhere, they're natural so of course they'll be everywhere. So, don't let some person with no evidence tell you there are aliens on Mars and they it for a fact because someone else said it was true. If you ever want to be a scientist, you need to find your own evidence or make sure whoever you got the evidence from is correct. Also, you NEED to be skeptical.

The summer for students is a time to relax and enjoy time with their friends and family,to forget about school and focusing on releasing their pent up stress. Most students end up forgetting they have school project or just do them the day before school starts up again, if it the project is designed by a teacher, The teacher would be giving students a project on something they were working on in class,which the students didn't enjoy and didn't hear or focus on because they were bored. The work the teacher put in to the making and setting up the project,giving them links to get information,giving them videos,giving them easy to understand resources,finding the answer and giving them specific questions, would end up going to waste and would just be wasting the teachers time which could be spent with family and loved on. Teachers are at work most of the day which is seven to eight hours or more that they spend at work and some times end up staying late to finish grading or finish setting up for the next day or making work for students that need to catch up,by the time they get home they are to tired to spend time with their family. The students don't learn anything because its about a topic they don't even like or have no interest in. I support having the project be student designed ,Instead students will chose a topic of their choice something their interested in this way they will have to do research,find evidence,give supporting facts,find links,find videos,make an appealing presentation,learn more about their topic of choice. for example If students chose a topic they are actually interested in there's a higher chance they'll do the project because students are more willing to learn about a topic they are already interested in. another reason i support having student designed projects is not only do the students learn something new but the teacher does as well, having it be a topic most students or teachers don't know anything about helps everyone in the class learn something new or at least helps them expand their knowledge. Which results in students learning about something they enjoy,more students turning in their work,less stress for the teacher,gives students an oppurtnites to work with crowds,expands their knowledge on a topic,all the teacher would have to do is set up how the students will be graded and whats expected of them or what it should look like. Another benefit of having it be student designed is the student that spent his time learning about this topic can transfer his knowledge to his classmate who might learn something new or gain an interest or have an interest in the topic the student worked on. Having project be students designed is a simpler more efficient way of having the students learn about new topics and using the skills they learned in class to find the information and facts about the topic which takes a little stress of the searchers shoulders and gives the students something to work on if their not doing anything during the summer its an efficient way to occupies their time while helping them learn and seeing that their learning even in the summer. This is why i support having summer projects be student designed and not teacher designed their are more benefits to having a student design his own project then having a teacher waste time and put useless effort in to something they won't do.",4,1619320000000.0,3357,3367,his is why ,Unannotated,Unannotated 4,,,,,Virginia,Independent,,Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

I do belive having these types of computers in a classroom is valuable. Having this in a class room also means you might not even need a teacher anymore, maybe just an instructor. Reasons why I believe this is a valuable is because technology is advancing, students faces don't lie, and this later on can lead to further inventions. Now, im going to say why I believe in these reasons.

First, technology is advancing. Many schools have thrown out he old fashioned paper and pencil learning style. Many schools have computerized progams that students use majority of their time spent in school. As they said in the passage this stystem can detect when a student is getting bored, or even when a student is not understanding. Many students don't learn at a high learning pace, so having a computer progam that understands that and detects when a student is having trouble is good. A teacher can't be everywhere at once, so if a progam is able to detect that, and help the student thats also helps the teacher out.

Second, students faces don't lie. You would be able to tell a confused face from a mile away. If computers detected when students were confused this is an easier way of finding out what the student needs help with. If a computer program is explaining a subject step by step, and all of a sudden the computer detects the student becoming confused this helps a teacher know were a student became lost. Many students won't admit to them not knowing, they'll try and find a way to understand,but at the same time many won't.

Lastly, this one idea can lead to further inventions. It many more things you can create when it comes to face action recgonition. With technology running the world today you never know what somebody can come up with. For example, Apple uses face recgonition for a possible way to unlock your phone. Another example is robots. Another example is a face scanner that could take attendance for you as students come into your classroom. The Facial action coding can play a part in telling the child's mood as they enter. Technology is too advanced to not take takeover. If it was my call i'd say bring in the Facial Action Coding Systems.

In Conclusion, I do believe this is valuable. I belive it will help much more in a classroom than many people expect. My reasons with the technology being advanced, students face expressions, and the ideas can open further gateways to new inventions are some reasons on why I believe people should consider this to be in a classroom. With that being said, I do believe this would be valuable to a classroom.",4,1619190000000.0,1646,1699,"

The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to read students' emotional expressions. Being able to adjust or identify how a student is feeling might prove to be invalueable.

Boredom is a very common feeling in school. It disengages students, stopping them from participating and paying attention all together.

According to the article A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Technology continues to play a more prominent role in education, this technology could help every student learn and stay interested. Identifying what the student is feeling could make crucial adjustments to the learning plan and the students would be better off for it.

This technology could be valuable for students in a non-academic way. Teachers being able to understand what a student is feeling could be life-saving. People experience problems of different kinds every single day. In paragraph seven the article states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.""

Maybe you should think twice about using it while you are driving. Drivers that put a hand on a cell phone while driving can cause them to get distracted and cause an accident. The car accident can lead up to taking a human's life. Even if the accident is not big it still could have been prevented by not using your cell phone.

Car accidents are one of the main things that are caused by drivers who use their cell phones but it's not the only things that gets caused by using your phone while you're driving. Sometimes you might pull your phone out at a red light but you don't realize the light has turned green which means you're causing traffic. Traffic is something mostly every driver hates. What if the person behind you has somewhere important to be but thanks to you you're holding them back because you got distracted with your phone? If someone is calling you and you have your phone in your purse or somewhere else in the car you're going to get distracted trying to pull it out of where you have it. If you have Bluetooth on your car you should connect it so it's easier to answer the call without having to try pull your phone out of where it's at. If you do not have Bluetooth, you should try putting your phone on do not disturb so that way you won't have the temptation to want to pull it out. Maybe even fully shut it down or just turn the sound off.

Every day, every hour, every minute as we continue with our life's a car accident occurs due to someone using their phone. Using your cell phone while driving is a big no. Phone calls are not the only thing that get you distracted while driving but you got to remember your social medias are blowing up which means you're getting a notification every here and there. Just knowing your friends texted you or someone posted / sent you something you'll most likely want to take a quick little glance at your phone but then that's going to want to make you use it for even longer which gets you distracted. Maybe you don't like what's on the radio so you want to use your aux to you can put a song you actually like if this does occur just wait till you're at red light but as soon as you're done doing that put it away you don't want to cause traffic. All of these things are ways your cell phone can get you distracted.

Stop using your cell phones while the car is on drive. Think about the people who are walking around you and driving around you. What if there's a baby in the car? Let's say you get in an accident you just hit someone's family think about what if that was your family who just got injured because you decided to pull out your phone, because you got distracted liking someone's new Instagram post, because you just had to take a selfie for snapchat. All of that could have waited till you got to your destination. Stop letting these little things get to you. Now think about it was pulling your phone really worth it now you just hurt not only the family but yourself, your car is all distorted. Everything that just happened could have been stopped if you only would have waited and not let your phone distract you.

Some people never realize how much a cell phone can actually cause. This because some people never stop and think about their actions. Yes, your cell phone might be small but the impacts it can cause are huge. Next time you want to pull your cell phone out wait till you get to your destination because a phone call or message is not more important than your own life. If someone important is calling your or texting just tell them, you were driving and they should be able to understand that.

A picture, song, video, etc. is not worth you getting yourself hurt or hurting someone else is not worth or even making some have a bad because you made them get stuck in traffic. Maybe you didn't even hurt yourself but you did hurt someone else just because you're ok doesn't mean you couldn't have hurt someone else bad. You need to get use to not having the urge to pull out your phone every time you get a notification.

I am a student athlete at this school and I think that it should stay at a C grade average.

Considering compaines like Ford or General Motors have been making them for a long time and still run strong it is a very strange idea. Would the advantages we so strange though? Some advantages are less pollution, more space, less stress, more money for the indvidual and more. If you think about all of these it really adds up to a better and healthier planet.

A town in Germany called Vauban, has restricted the use of cars. It is a car free town according to the article

In German Suburb, Life goes on without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal. People don't have garages attached to there houses and there really isn't any parking other then the one parking garage they have that costs almost as much as a house to keep a car there. Really it would just be a pain to have a car there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She finds herself less stressed without a car and happier.

If there were less cars it would mean there would be vastly less pollution. The burning of gasoline creates green house gasses and slowly destroys this beautiful planet of ours. Cities like beijing in China or Paris in France create a lot of these Green house gasses according to

Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer. Paris created so much they had to ban drivng and if someone did they had to pay fines for it. Thankfully though it has come down less and less each year in Paris since 2005.

If we didn't have cars we would have space for so much more. Imagine what we could do with all the space parking lots and garages take up. We could be so much more efficent about using it. Also think of how much gasoline costs per gallon. If you think about how much we spend on gas in our lifetime we could have spent that on so many other things. You could buy a 100 of those flat screen Tv's you've always wanted to watch the big game on. Cars have become a nusance and slowly more and more people are seeing that.

Not everyone is a very good driver either. Thinking of all the times you have road raged because somebody wasn't being a safe and smart driver and almost got you hurt. With no cars there is no chance of that ever happening. There would be no car accidents because there would be no cars. You wouldn't have to be stressed and worried when you go somewhere unlike you are with a car.

These are just some of the advantages of not having cars. Cities and towns have seen what life is like without them and they are starting to lean more that direction. People are happier and safer. The world is healthier and less polluted. Cars are becoming a thing of the past and maybe someday they won't even be relative.

110457,5153038,671D0569C835,train,"Dear Florida State Senator,

Every 4 years, many people vote for a president they think will lead the United States to greatness; some, however, don't know that they are voting for the Electoral College to vote on their choise. This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!

Because of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.

According to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.

Florida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the ""swing"" states to win ""the people's"" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the ""swing"" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!

In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery. Many people will thank you!

Getting advice is a good thing but it could be a bad thing as well. It could either help you become a better person or a bad person, advice could help you become a good person if people give you good advice such as donating clothes to the homeless or giving money to charity, but it could also result in you becoming a bad person due to someones bad advice, they could tell you to do drugs or smoke which aren't very good things.

Advice could also encourage you into something like maybe getting into sports such as football or baseball. Another way advice could encourage you is by you trying to raise money for something and spending your money wisely. Although people could encourage you to do horrible things so you will have to choose weather you listen to them or not.

One more way advice can help you is by teaching you. Advice could help you learn a lot of things like maybe learning that you're good at working on vehicles or you're very good at cleaning them. you could also learn a lot more like good universities to go to when your older or know what kind of job to get that will pay you a good amount of money.

29482,AAAXMP138200001127352144_OR,B4F68B3BBAA4,train,"If there's one time of the year that students consider to be hallowed or holy, it's summer vacation. Any tampering that a school might do with this break is considered blasphemy against their sacred holiday. If a school system decided to introduce a program of graded projects for students to complete during summer vacation, it would be in their best interest to give students say in what they work on. School projects assigned over summer break should be student-designed because it would help foster a desire for learning, it would be easier to incorporate, and it would improve the experience of the teachers grading them.

When students spend hours and hours studying topics they have no interest in over the course of 12 years, it often creates a disillusionment with learning and the pursuit of knowledge. Summer is a time of escape from this tedium for students, and asking them to complete further teacher-designed projects over the summer would exacerbate the problem. If the school allowed students to choose a premise or topic of study for their projects, it would increase student engagement with and interest in completing the assignment. Granted, it would still be school work, and most students would still be frustrated with its presence in their vacation, but offering choice would allow more students to actively want to work on their project, learn more, and pursue their topic. School crushes intellectual curiosity. I've observed this in my life in the contrast between my and my peers' enjoyment of novels. I love to read, and do it often. Most of the people I know never read a book unless it's for school. This is because, from a young age, I had the choice to read, and reading was its own reward. For other students, they were forced to read, either in school or by their parents. In this system, reading was a means to reach a reward, whether it was a good grade on an assignment or a treat from their parents. Reading for fun offers them no reward. By forcing students to do projects they didn't choose over the summer, it further perpetuates the belief that learning is only good for getting the grade they want. Letting students choose their project would partly restore the connection between learning and enjoyment.

If officials attempt to institute these projects in a school system that has previously had no summer assignments, the push back from students and their parents would be immense. The school board would receive hundreds of cliched complaints of summer being ""students' time to relax"" and so on. Letting students design their projects would ease the tension. There would still be a grandly negative response, but once students learned that they would be allowed to choose a topic of study, it would assuage at least many of them. To illustrate, any class I've been that's had to read a novel for school has hated doing so (I outline why in the previous paragraph). Assignments where students got to pick their own novel or choose between a group of novels, though, were received with less vitriol. While students still didn't like the idea of having to read for class, having the choice of what to read meant they were more willing to do it. Students don't want to be told how they'll be spending their summers. If they choose their projects, they'll have less of a sense of being mandated and it will be easier to institute this assignment.

Now, some might say that giving students choice in their projects would lead to many not pursuing anything of value. If the purpose of the summer project is to ""continue learning"" when kids aren't at school, isn't it a risk to give students the freedom to research something unrelated to their academic studies? This is problem has a simple, obvious solution: these will be student-designed, teacher-approved projects. To experience the benefits explained in the previous paragraphs, schools need not provide students with complete freedom, only a feeling of choice. Teachers will be able to keep students on track by guiding them toward project topics that will assist them in the next school year, and students still get to pursue a topic they're interested in.

Finally, student-designed projects would offer teachers a less monotonous grading process. Throughout my school career, whenever we've been assigned projects where we're allowed to choose our topics of study, my teachers always comment that they're much more interesting and enjoyable to grade than other projects. Coming back to school after the freedom of summer is difficult for teachers too, and getting to grade projects students were passionate about creating is a way to ease into the year. For the next 36 weeks, teachers will be grading tedious collections of the same assignment. At the beginning of the year, they should have a collection of assignments that they can find some interest in reviewing.

Students treat summer with a protectiveness nearing religious fanaticism. Schools encroaching on this time could be met with disastrous results. Introducing a system of summer assignments could cause an uproar with the student body, but this would be lessened if students had the option to choose the topic of their projects. It's all about the choice. Having this choice stimulates students' intellectual curiosity, lessens the negative reaction to the assignment's institution, and makes everything far more pleasant for the teachers in the center of the affair.                        ",6,1618870000000.0,4149,4158,"

Imagine going to a school for a class that's far distanced away from home, then you get a call from back home informing you that there's an emergency. How would that make you feel being in a completely different state to take a class when there's a family emergency back at home? All students have responsibilities outside of receiving their education. Some students also must pay large amounts of money to receive the education they need. Some people may say, education is the most significant aspect of a student's life. However, there are more important aspects to consider in a student's life, such as taking care of your family and other responsibilities, or being mindful of the cost it takes to get the education needed.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home by the satisfaction that they won't become homesick. Some college students tend to be homesick after leaving there family to go to school far away from home. This issue can result in depression and the inability to complete their schoolwork successfully. The reason for benefits of being able to attend classes from home would be for students to not become homesick, leading to failure in their studies. Some people may say students can always go back home to visit family, or use the FaceTime app to see them. Clearly, that would be an option for a student to use as far as seeing their family, but it's not the same as being able to have a real connection and presence of your family everyday. Students also have other responsibilities to take care of at home, such as family emergencies. For example, this year of 2020, the corona virus has been quickly spreading worldwide, affecting many citizens of the US and other countries. The sickness could reach a student's family member, resulting in the student having the responsibility to take care of the rest of the family during their time of crisis. Any other responsibilities to be mindful of at home are significant in students lives that require the limitation of traveling far distances. With the opportunity for students to attend classes from home by using online sources, or video conferencing will eliminate homesickness and increase the ability to take care of responsibilities at home. Some people may say that students have to make sacrifices for their education. However, why would students run the extra mile of receiving their education, when it can be easily be obtained in another way.

Another benefit from being able to attend classes from home would be schools willing to occupancy the students needs. Most of the time, when traveling far distances away from home, it can be expensive and the price of being in a new housing is difficult for students to pay. Every student receiving an education may not be wealthy enough or have the financial stability to move far distances from home. Attending classes with distance learning by utilizing online or video conferencing can be beneficial, so that student doesn't have to pay large amounts of money. For example, imagine a student having the opportunity to attend classes in another state but the rent for housing in that state is expensive. It would be beneficial for the the school who has given them the opportunity to take classes there to offer distance learning. The reason for schools being able to offer distance learning is beneficial is because the school should be willing to occupancy all students needs. For example, I attend a school that's not within my zone school due to being a participant of the International Baccularete Program. Before joining the program, they guaranteed transportation needs if I couldn't provide my own transportation. I ride the hub bus every morning to get to school on time. Since the program was willing to occupancy my needs in receiving my education, all schools and programs must do the same. Some people may say it's the students responsibility to take care of their own educational needs. Clearly, they are wrong because educational organizations must support the needs of every student despite the amount of how much help they need.

Some people may say schools offering distance learning for students to attend classes by using online or video conferencing isn't beneficial. However, they are wrong because there are many benefits using that option, such as decreasing homesickness, taking care of family and responsibilities at home, limiting expensive needs, and schools willing to support their students. These benefits can reassure a student receiving a successful, comfortable, and significant education. Clearly, there's a large amount of things to consider in a students life when they are receiving an education and it's important for the student and the school to have a working system regarding needs and aspects of that student's life.

I think it would actually be better for people 18. If you are 18 it gives you more free time to get a full time good paying job and you will still be able to go to school. It is not as hard on your body as going to school either, saying that meaning when you work and you go to school most days you would have to leave school and go straight to work. With online classes you can wake up for class do your work an when you finish you can go back to sleep until its time for you to go to work. Believe it or not you have more time to do your class work to, you can do it before you go to work or as soon it is given to you. You just have to know how to manage your time right and wanna do good in school and maintain a steady job.

Taking online classes really gives you a lot of free time you just have to know what to do with it. If it was me who had a chance to take only online classes. I would get me a full time job some where and I would do both. when I say that I know it sounds stressful and hard to do but when you really put thought into it you would have time to do them both. Say if I was working over night I could wake up around Noon I could do my work and then I could go back to sleep and rest more before I go to work. I could really picture that working out.

If someone is to try this with online classes it world be easier on their body because, you dont have to wake up and go to school and stay up all day and then go to work you can rest a little more before you go to work. Then you are not gonna be tired at work you can come home and sleep and then you dont have to wake up early after you get off of work late. You may not know it but rest is a big thing I never understood that until I got a job an now that I am not getting that much sleep I realized that your body needs rest because without rest your body is not right until you get the rest you need.

The good part about the whole thing is that you will have a lot more time to do your classwork. I am not talking about a hour of class time im talking about you can sit down and finish all of your work at your own pace you will get much more done in less time and you will still have more free time. you will still be able to enjoy yourself on your days off with no school work or if you have some you have not done you can do it on your days you have off.

97075,AAAOPP13416000025556,48237AFE924E,train,"Cars today are driving closer and to being able to drive on their own. This can change the way people live and how people use tranportation in a positive way. Even though they aren't entirely ""driverless"" and still need a driver it's still a step in that direction. Driverless cars would take over public transportion system, create less accidents, and help people who can't drive well.

Driverless cars are esstientally going to be the future public transportation. The cars will end up taking the postions of taxis and even buses. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisons a future where these cars will offer much more flexiblity while cutting the useage of fuel by half.

These self drivng cars will also be safer for others on the road reducing the chances of a crash. Car companies have taken extreme precautions with these machines fitting them with senors all over the cars. Google has taken the idea into its own hands with some companies like Toyota. They've modified a Toyota Prius and have outfitted it with a postiton-estimating sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted ner the review mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. These sensors will apply brakes and reduce power from the engine so that the driver at hand can take over.

Of course these driverless cars will need a passenger that a operate the car in case of an emergancy. In 2013, BMW announced a development of the ""traffic Jam Assistant"", which allows the cars to handle driving functions at speed up to 25 mph. Special touch sensors make sure a driver is keeping hold of the wheel at all times. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but still need to notify the driver when it need human skills navigating through areas like work zones.

On the other hand, some people wouldn't lay their lives in the hands of a self driving car. Driving laws today focus on keeping the drivers, passengers and pefestrians safe. Today, traffic laws are written with the thought of a human driver controlling the car. In most states, it has been illegal to to even test driverless car; but scientist beileve that more states will allow testing after seeing results from those states that have been doing it already.

This future of self driving cars is near. Automakers like Telsa have projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving by it self 90% of the time. Other companies like Mercedes- Benz , Audi and Nissan have plans to release cars that drive by themselves by 2020.

Every four years on the first tuseday in November we the citizens of the Unites States Of America vote for the next persident to be in office. As you already know for this to happen the they must have all the Electoral College or Election popluar vote. Which is not how elcetions should be conducted. It should only be based off of popular votes.

Voters do not ways have control as to whom their electors vote for. Sometimes it can be anyone not holding public office. In the second sourse titled

The Idefensiable Electoral College it states, "" Who are electors? they can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committe, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" This indicates that voters have dont really have control. The electoral college votes has many reason for being unfair to voters, and the winner-take-all is one of many. Line thirteen of the second sourse, it states ""the electoral college is unfair. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state"" this indicates that candidates did not and will not spend time in states there they won't win votes. They focus on larger states to gain there votes. It has been said

"" the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational.""

With this Electoral vote should be eliminated from the final vote. With the popular votes the elcetion can be a fair race to presidence

Bob Dole stated

"" Abolish the electoral college!""

. There are many reasons why elcetoral college should be abolished. But In the defence of The electoral votes this can be the tie breaker. If the candidates come to a tie in popular votes The electoral votes will establish which one recieved the most electoral college votes. But this should only be used in case of a tie in popular votes. ""Elcetoral votes is a lack of democratic pediagree."" Within no region is there enough electoral votes to elect a president. A candidate with regional appeal isn't like to secced the presidency because the other regions will feel excuded. the region will feel as if the president doesn't not care for there interest. People believe that wil the elcetoral votes their votes will have no effect. In the section "" run off elections it states ""

they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were to picked by popular vote...""

This implies with the electoral college is not fair because voters vote and their vote has no effect on the election, because its based off of the electoral college. And this isnt fair!

To Solve this problem there should be absolutly no more electoral votes during elcetion. All ecetions should be based off of popular votes. you have the power to correct this issue so i should be done. Electoral votes dont give a fair chances.

133733,AAAXMP138200001515792125_OR,BF2E86982E3A,train,"Distance learning is a huge advantage and will be very beneficial if implemented in more school systems. With the technological advances of modern times this thought of distance learning is becoming a strong reality. Although there is not a human connection, distance learning can be very interactive and replace ""in school learning"" for those who decide to take such a course. What the future presents is unknown, but for schooling, technology has already played a huge role and will keep advancing the learning experience. Distance learning is beneficial for both students and schools because, it may minimize commute count, save money for schools, and give students a better learning environment.

Students who live a great distance from school take the daily commute which may be up to, or even surpass, 30 minutes. This puts students in a very difficult situation. From having to wake up earlier to the amount of gas spent a week. One of the main concerns of such a long commute every morning is the gas. Gas is not cheap and as a student money is not always abundant. This may lead to an absurd amount of money only saved for gas. With distance schooling this problem can be easily taken away. Distance learning can save students a great deal of money that can be put towards other important wants and needs. Waking up early is a trial students, teachers, and most people around the world face every day. When living 30 minutes or more away from school, that commute only makes students have to wake up even earlier. This may lead to sleeping in class or even falling asleep behind the wheel, but with distance learning a student can wake up and not rush to get ready for school. Distance learning gives students the time they need to rest and be ready to learn when most convenient. The advantage that distance learning has for those who drive a great distance is hugely beneficial both financially and for the health of that student.

Secondly, not all school systems have great deals of money handed out by the government. With the implementation of distance schooling many schools across the nation can save money and use it in beneficial ways. A problem schools face around the nation is overcrowding. Schools with too many students need to either expand the building, which is highly expensive, or build trailers, also highly expensive. The money that is going into add-ons for schools is a major waste when distance learning can take that all away. With more kids taking distance learning classes the less students there are in the schools. With distance learning becoming a growing concept in schools the need for teachers may also deplete, along with salaries that are no longer needed to be paid. This can be an advantage for school budgets; leading to more opportunities within schools for the students. Although there may be less teachers within the schools systems, those who do work may receive a higher salary since there are less teachers than before. With more training in teaching, a spot as a teacher can become more prestigious than it already is and be a job that more people can truly strive for. The fluctuation of money can be very strong with the implementation of distance schooling and will benefit not only students but also school systems.

Furthermore, students that do not enjoy the work environment of schools can gain a great deal of knowledge when they are in the comfort or their own home. Students who do not enjoy schools, including the peers they are along side with, may have trouble paying attention in class which may make it very difficult to succeed. From home students may feel more comfortable and ready to learn. Online classes may offer students times to choose when taking the class. These times would be no where near as early as the start of school, so for those who do not have that drive for education in the morning can take their time and get prepared for their online class. This gives distance learning a big advantage for students who are uncomfortable in the schools work environment. Along with the help of parents, nudging students to get their work done, may play a role in distance learning. Being comfortable and attentive helps a persons work ethic drastically, distance learning brings students to a combination of both. Although some students may not enjoy learning from the comfort of their own home, does not mean students should not take a leap of faith and give distance learning a try due to all the benefits.

To conclude, distance learning is an up and coming discussion that needs to be taken to more schools. Schools systems can benefit off distance learning along with the students.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because that person will learn from their mistakes, someone else's advice could be beneficial in the future, and the advice you receive you can use to help others.

When you seek advice from others, you can sometimes learn from your mistakes. When you fail at something, just ask a companion or family member for some help.

When they tell you what you can do, just use that advice and you will never mess up again. But, if their advice doesn't work just don't use it. At the point where their advice doesn't work, just ask someone else for their opinion.

If someone gives you advice, you should use it for the future. Another person's opinion on something could be beneficial later on in life. If your friend gives you really helpful advice, use should use it the next time you have that problem. That's what I do in most situations. Your friend's advice will be so memorable that you will never forget it.

Every time you get advice from someone, you should try to remember it. Later on in life you can give that advice to someone else. Besides, helping others is a good thing to do. For instance, if you come up on a problem that you cannot fix and someone tells you how to fix it you should remember that. Then, if you see someone struggling with the same problem, help them out.

122706,5196467,5AEDBC21EF30,train,"I believe that choosing the president of the United States should be choosen by popular vote and not by the Electoral Collage. I believe this way because I think that the people should have the right to choose who represent their country, not the House of Representatives/Senate. The Electoral College in most cases is unfair to most voters because of the whole ""winner-take-all policy"". Some states have less electoral votes given to them and that may seem unfair to some. The Electoral College method is basically electors that elect the president and not the people which I think is completely useless.

I believe that the best argument should be between the people and not members of the Electoral College. The most worrying part of using the Electoral College to vote for the president and vice president insteded of using the peoples votes is that the elections are just being thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegates choose the president and the Senate will choose the vice president. Candidates dont't spend time in states they know will have no chance of winning. they only focus on the tight races in ""swing states"" that are most likely to pay closes attention to the campaign. The Electoral College puts most of the weight on the large states because of their large populations.

Getting rid of the Electoral College is a better decison for the people so they get a say in how they want their county to be and not how the goverment wants the country to be. If we use the peoples vote we would get more accurate votes and it would be fair for everyone. The Electorlal College is pretty much what the government wants rather than what the people want which is why many citizens have problems with our current president, so if the people could just get a say in who they think should run the country they should. When we vote for a presidential candidate we are actually voting for a slate of electors and not for the president. Some of the smaller states don't get to see any campaign ads like the larger states do so they are basically putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters.

The Electoral College is hurting our county because we are not getting the accurate votes we think we're getting. Citizens are not going to want to vote anymore because of how unfair these campaigns are. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an election.                          ",3,1615580000000.0,387,472,Some states have less electoral votes given to them and that may seem unfair to some. ,Claim,Claim 3,Effective,1615580000000.0,I believe that choosing the president of the United States should be choosen by popular vote and not by the Electoral Collage,Position,Florida,Text dependent,"Source 1: ""What is the Electoral College?"", by the Office of the Federal Register

Of the new policy of cell phone, students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, and to be also used only on free time periods like lunch.

The reason why students should bring their cell phones is because students can use them for emergencies and other uses like calling their parents to pick them up after school. If phones are used in class, they may get a warning or be taken away by the teacher. When taken by the teacher, they may receive their phone after the class period.

When an emergency happens, Students can call their parents or call for help when they are instructed to do so.

Calling their parents can let them know that they are all safe from a natural disaster. Either it is a flood, earthquake, tornado, etc. Students letting their parents know that they are fine shows the responsibility they carry.

Calling parents after school can let them know what time their child gets out of school. When not having a cell phone, certain students have to use the phones in class and/or the ones in the office. If so, they may or may not be able to get out of school on time. Parents always have to make sure they leave on time to know what happens at school and after school.

Having parents to know that their child is doing good in school means that their parents are happy that their child had a grea

The last reason why phones should be brought to school is because that students should enjoy a nice school year. Having a great school year for students means that they can memorize all the times they had for the year. Letting them know they had fun is that it leaves them with a happy day. It can make kids happy for themselves and the people around them. Also it makes friends closer with one another when they talk about their day.

But wouldn't it be great if everyone did an extracurricular activity. Their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day. I think kids should have to do extracurricular activities because you make new friends, you help out your school, and it creates other opportunities.

While doing extracurricular activities you can make new friends. Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.

Some extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot. It may be in a small way but it still helps. Groups that make the yearbook or students that serve on the student council are helping the school out. They are helping to keep the school in order and to keep students happy. Other extracurricular activities like football and basketball help their school and community by winning games this helps the school make money, it helps the community by providing entertainment. Some schools even have environmental clubs that help the school, the community, and even the world. All in all, extracurricular activities help the school and community.

Most importantly extra curricular activities create more opportunities. When doing extracurricular activities you might find out that you are really good at something. People that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college. You might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing. Also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college. Extracurricular activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding.

Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work.

It may not be perfect but every method has its flaws, including popular vote, respectively. The popular voting system is not the best method since it can end up not defining  certainty of the outcome. Electoral college has prevailed until this day and it should remain this way for the United States of America.

Although electoral college may be called outdated, irrational and unfair (Brandon Plumer 14). This isnt true because if it were so outdated and unfair it would have been substituted or changed by another system but it has remained because of its effiecency. This system is certaintly not unfair because  as stated in a article by Richard A. Posner,he explains ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" As for the irrational portion of the opposing view, as stated in "" in defense of the electoral college..."" article has mutiple reasons but one of them is ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.""

No region (South,Northeast,etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""

The single best argument against Electoral College may be called ""the disaster factor"" as claimed by Brandom Plumer in his article opposing the Electoral College. Certainty of Outcome is a strong point for Richard a. Posner in his article defending the electoral college and carefully states ""A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" He (Richard Posner) also reminds the reader that the  Electoral College avoids issues in elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast and there is no pressure for a ""run-off election"" when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

Another factor brought to our attention by ""the indefensible electoral college..."" article is that since the Electoral College uses the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont lose time in states they are most likely to not win in and they focus mostly on ""swing"" states. Although the ""swing"" states system is used, it is simply utilized becauseit induces the candidates as seen in 2012's election. But the voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay more attention to the campaign, and it is decreed that the most thoughtful voters should be the chosen ones to decide the election.

Ultimately with all the information cited it is quite obvious which option is best for the U.S. Electoral College may have it's cons but the pros outweigh it. This is not a new method. It was defined by the Founding Fathers that wrote our constitution that has held our country in unisom until this day. Now in 2015 it is still the leading force in the government and should be kept that way. the Electoral college is the best suited for America and should'nt be altered.

Sincerly,

My opion on driverless cars is that sometimes it could be good and sometimes is could be bad like for an example. when your very tired and you need to go somewhere your car can take you were you need to go without you having to drive it. If you are ever in a hurry your car can drive you without you being late.

Now for my opinion on the bad things about driverless cars. Driverless cars are also bad because you could be texting and you would'nt here your alert that the car gives you when it can drive at that certain part in time and you end up crashing into something or hurting someone. This means a human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.

I think that driverless car would be a good experiment because we would be able to see who could handle it and who can't handle it. Some people might think that they can handle it and they go and bye a driverless car and go to start it and dont no what to do but the other half would no what to do right off bat. I also think that the car would be more expensive than any car that has ever been made because if what it does this car is basically the future.

But why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver half of the time? Well i guess ill tell you why. Most of the people think that it would be fun sometimes because not often you get to drive a driverless car its interesting in my opinion. But in a way the car system is really a saftey system if you pay attention to what all that you are doing but if you don't it could be hazert.

Experts say passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent ofgreenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas like the United States. If people took their bike or walked to their destination it could help people lose weight and be healthy.

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifiying smog. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

Car-free day became a big hit in Bogota, Colombia. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin america city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor.

Cars should be cut down in use in many other country's espically in places like the U.S where cars are used all the time. Experts say America's love affair with vechicles seems to be cooling. Miles driven in the U.S peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives.

156265,AAAXMP138200000813622810_OR,B2F7B08EA688,train,"''When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person."" I think that the reason why people don't ask only one person for advice is that it gives you a chance picking more than one advice.

The thing I learned is sometimes whne people give you advice some people say it for their own good or either for their own bad. They say it for their own good because that person wants you to make good choices in life. The other people say it for their own bad so they can see you makke bad choices in life and see you not doing well. It's always going to be that good or bad advice to choice from. To make good choices you have to pick the good advice that the person gave you because they said it for their own good.

Not all the time people got the same opinion on things sometimes they have different opinions on the advice. You'll ask different people on advice and you will get either a bad one or a good opinion on the advice. Good opinons for the advice will always end up making you make good chocies in life or the road your walking in. The good opinions is for them to see you doing good things. The good opinions are always the good ones for you to choice from.

The other one is when you ask someone their are always people that got to say something about you. You never know what somebody got to say about the advice your asking for. They might judge you for asking for some type of advice. Some people always got good or bad opinions of you. People would judge for seeing you doing better because you went for a good advice.

A good reason why you should ask a couple people for advice is that you will always end up picking good choices. The more good choices you pick it would cause you walk in a good road. That's why you should ask more than one person to give you great advice. For example, say that you ask one person to give you advice and say that the advice they gave you wasn't great and you can't do noting about it , that's why it is important asking couple people for advice because asking only one person won't be great. That's why people always end up asking more than one person for advice for their own good.\

Lastly people asking for advice they would be expecting a good advice. For example, say that I ask a couple of friends for advice about soccer, I would be expecting a good advice not a bad one. As humans we always expect something great not bad. The people you should be asking for advice would be the ones who already expeirment it while going through it. You can ask someone who didn't went through but they might give you advice but it won't be great one.

In conclusion, it is always a good idea asking more than one person for advice. That would be for your own good and cause you make good choices.",4,1617900000000.0,1546,1657,A good reason why you should ask a couple people for advice is that you will always end up picking good choices ,Claim,Claim 4,Adequate,1617900000000.0,I think that the reason why people don't ask only one person for advice is that it gives you a chance picking more than one advice.,Position,Virginia,Independent,,Seeking multiple opinions,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

168934,AAAXMP138200001472442810_OR,B08943432C17,train,"As a student, transitioning from grade levels can be hard. You're in a new environment, with new friends, and new obstacles. One of those obstacles could be choosing a course. I remember that me and my mom had arguments on what I should do for sixth grade. Should I play guitar or do band? My mom wanted me to play guitar but I chose band. I was influenced by a lot of friends and family to do band but my mom wanted me to play guitar. Having chosen band I enjoy it and find it a lot more interesting then guitar. I do think that seeking opinions helps make better choices.

One of the reason that I think hearing other peoples opinion leads to better choices is because you have less stress. A Harvard study found that 8/10 people who share their problems understand and feel less stressed out about it. This is simply just saying that talking to people makes you feel better about yourself. The less stress you have the more clearly you can think. Listening to other peoples stories and advice really made me feel less conflicted on my choices.

Another reason why listening to different opinions will lead to better choices is because you will have a stronger bond with your family. Kind of weird, right? Well, with a difficult decision you would normally go to your parents. According to USA Today, kids are talking to their parents less frequent. Since the 1960s the communication between parent and child has depleted, stated USA Today. This is basically stating that kids don't talk to their parents as much as they use to. It seems a little strange to some kids to go to their mom and ask if they should do economics or culinary art. Yet it makes the most sense. Even if our parents lived in different times then us they still know the struggle of making difficult choices and hearing different responses. For my high school curriculum my mom told me to do culinary art. I went to my friends and they all thought no, I shouldn't do it. I decide to go with it even though I wanted to do economics. So my mom started to teach me the basics of cooking. I think that if you have a choice and know someone who can help you with it you should take it. It doesn't matter if everyone else, who isn't a good chef, thinks its bad. You'll start to form a bond with them and yourself.

Another reason that listening to different opinions will lead to better choices is because it can help you academically. According to Scholastic, 3 out of 5 kids in a school said that they are in a high level class because of a friend. These classes include geometry, algebra, and honors P.E. for middle school. This is basically saying that kids, who might be flunking the class, are there because of a friend. In middle school friends and family have a big impact on you, especially when it comes to choices.

Hearing all the different sides will make it easier to understand. It will also give you a chance to think about your future. The more opinoins you hear the clearer the right choice will be. Academically if you have the smarts to do the high level class go for it but if your not sure then talk to someone about it.

Ultimately, listening to different opinions will make you think less about your desicion. It will also improve the relationship with your family as well as helping you academically. Overall being able to see the different sides of a situation will help you in anything you do. You shouldn't build up stress over something. You should talk about it. That is the only way we know how to deal with a problem. To talk about it.                        ",5,1618240000000.0,2401,2790,"According to Scholastic, 3 out of 5 kids in a school said that they are in a high level class because of a friend.

Teachers setting up their projects for their students is a much more organized decision than rather having the students design it themselves.

Me being a student I find it easier for my teacher to post the directions online, its faster and just incase I need help on the assignment, I can ask one of my classmates who have the class or are planning on taking the class for extra help if needed. Teacher-designed projects are also easier for the teacher to understand, for example, during the summer I had two summer projects and both of them were created by my teachers, once they were turned in by majority of the students, they were quickly graded and in the grade book. Having the directions already sorted out saves you a lot of time and saves you a major headache because you'll already have somewhat of an idea of what the professor expects from their students, as well as it's easier for them because they'll already have known everything thats supposed to be done and could help you understand if you didn't meet the requirements.

From a teachers prospective, it might be easier for them to come up with an idea for a project because you don't really see a lot of student-designed projects, usually professors have detailed instructions on what, and how to do an assignment. Throughout my high school career, the only project I've ever had to construct myself would be an essay in an English class, other than that I've never been faced with an assignment that wasn't created by the teacher. It's a teachers job to make assignments for their students, how is a student supposed to learn if there isn't a set of well-planned directions for an assignment taught by the teacher?

130719,2021003160,2FB17659DA36,train,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it would be a great idea to have the students be able to bring their cell phones to school. After school they can use them for various reasons. If the student is staying for practice or tutorial, they can call their parents or guardian to pick them up. If they miss the bus or need to clarify how to get home they can use their cell phone to contact their parents. The parent can also call the student if they need to talk to them about something. Students can use their phone to do research as well.

Another reason they should be aloud to use cell phones is because cell phones can be used after school too. Many students walk to McDonald's, Trade-winds, or other stores or restaurants in that area. The students need cell phones to be able to contact whoever is picking them up. During break students can also use cell phones for entertainment.

Students should only use cell phones in the designated time. I think you need to warn them that if they take advantage of having cell phones at school, they will be banned from school immediately. Any student who takes advantage of the new policy will be put into punishment and a number of continuous problems will shut the new policy down.

During class, students should not be able to use their cell phones, because they can start cheating, texting, or being off task. To stop this, I suggest that at the beginning of class teachers should pick up all cell phones.

Some other people knew that it was just a landform that was common on Mars. I am here to tell you that is was just a natural landform. NASA has evidence that will backup this statement. In the following paragraphs I will tell you about the evidence, the camera technology, and how the media affected the responds of people.

Many people will argue that the mesa on Mars is a face. Although it may look like a face, it isn't. In paragraph 1 it says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia..."" This quote tells us that the scientists were used to seeing these large landforms around the region. NASA wouldn't release these images if they thought aliens were involved. The object you see in the picture is simply a landform with shadows in just the right spot.

Back in 1976, the camera technology wasn't great. Many of the cameras had large pixles that made the pictures blury. In paragraph 10 it says, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This quote proves that the camera technology has improved greatly. Some conspiracy theorists aruge that even though the picture was not at high resolution, you can still see a face. This may be true,but you can also clearly see the shadows that made it look like a face.

The media had a significant impact on the Mars event. In paragraph 5 it says, ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows...and grocery store checkout lanes for 25 years."" This shows that the media has made people believe that there is a face on Mars.

After going back and taking a picture of the face years after the original photo was taken, you can no longer see the face. In paragraph 10 it says, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This goes onto prove that NASA was right the whole time about the ""Face"" on Mars. This statement also shows that NASA was working on this mystery too.

After looking at all the evidence and photos you can clearly see that the ""Face"" on Mars is just a landform. If you think there is life on Mars, think again.

If the new technology did not work to descibe people's expression then the computer would not do anything, computers are a smart technology and can do lots of things.

It is a good idea to read the emotional expressions of students because computers know how your feeling once you look into it. To figure out how your feeling the computer will take a 3-d picture model of your face. The new technology could only tell six emotions which are happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness.

The expressions people make are very universal. The new technology cannot describe how your feeling if your not showing no emotion.

Thoughts of whether projects should be student or teacher designed have been tossed around. Some students of course would choose to do projects of their own choosing. In my opinion projects should be teacher designed because there will be a higher chance of completion due to, a time frame, taking away pressure, and a quenching of students thirst for knowledge.

When it comes to any type of work there is a time frame in which it needs to be completed. When teachers assign students projects they are thought out and planned, if students are given the opportunity to design projects themselves especially over break there is the factor of procrastination. Teachers will assign students a project that is set in stone which will take away thoughts of changing the project over and over again which would lead to time loss. Teacher designed projects may not impact students summer break at all because, the student will know exactly what he or she has to do in order to complete project .

Teacher designed projects also take pressure off the students. Students may not know what kind of project will be worthy enough for a good grade and may second guess themselves. Some teachers have higher expectations for their students than others can which make some students feel pressured. Teacher designed projects will lower that feeling due to the fact students will not have to bend over backwards to create a project that will be enough to please his or her teacher.

People old and young have a thirst for knowledge students especially. Teachers may give students a project they know nothing about but the goal is for the student to keep learning while on break. When given a teacher designed project if the students have all the knowledge about the project, or not they will learn or discover new things. Projects require research which gives students the opportunity to discover tons of new information. Widening the students education and preparing them for next year. Student may pick an easy project that requires only prior knowledge which will keep them at same level of education they had before summer break. Which is why teacher designed projects will give students an opportunity to better themselves.

In conclusion, teacher designed projects are best for students. Some may argue that student designed projects will benifit the student more than a teacher designed project because of the chance of an easy grade. When a teacher designed project will give students the opprotunity to widen their knowledge. Teacher desigend projects make this possible by, giving a time frame, taking away pressure, and giving more knowledge to the student. ",5,1618940000000.0,1761,2310,"When given a teacher designed project if the students have all the knowledge about the project, or not they will learn or discover new things.

For most people that form of transportation is a car.

Cars are used not only as transportation but are also used for recreation and competiton.

Self-driving cars may take away from the recreation and competition parts and make the hobbies of many people become non-existant.

One could argue that roads would be safer with cars capable of driving themselves, but the reality is a computer is no replacement for a human brain.

A computer with all the little circuts and fuzes it has is not able to make a decision that solves problems beyond the one it is currently faced with.

Therefore car accidents will stil loccur and when an accident does occur who is to be held accountable?

Who wil pay the cost o fthe damage? ""Who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""(paragragh 9)

One cannot simply say that the the dumbest car is the one to blame.

Nor can he or she say that the drivers are at fault if they had no control over their car.

Driving can also be used as an escape.

Some people race their cars as a hobby and others just enjoy a nice Sunday cruise around town.

Either way they are not driving so they will not find the refuge from day-to-day life they seek.

What would be the fun of going to a track and sitting in a car you love and then have it drive itself around the track.

Pushing a car ro its max and diving into corners and accelerating out of them is what makes driving fun.

Without the roar of an engine reving at eight thousand RPM and the squeal of tires barely golding on to asphalt what would racing a car be?

A major issue with autonomous cars would be that of cost.

As the founder of the Google Car Project said ""Radar was a device at the top of a hill that costs two hundred million dollars.

It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack.""

The U.S. cannot afford a road system that will put us deeper into the sixteen trillion dollar hole we are in.

The price of cars would also rise making them for only people who could afford them.

A car with a higher price tag means a smaller market will be able to purchase them and less money is to be made.

Less money made means less money spent by the employees and that will make the economy worse.

Creating cars that drive themselves will take away from the hobbies of many people.

Transportation is a must in modern society.

Now, picture a conflict, and then a mad dash to the airport to declare love or patch things up between the protagonist and a prospective soulmate. In the end, the problem is solved, and the two people have found each other despite all odds. The outcome is picturesque, perfection tied up with a bow. However, it wasn't always this way. Something has to happen for the protagonist to finally hop into a taxi and speed off into the sunset. That something almost always takes place after the main character is overwhelmed with something they cannot control, something they find too hard to handle on their own. That something is advice. The value of advice to the protagonist is surely immeasurable, as it shows that someone cares, and provides them with a plethora of separate ways to look at the issue. Advice is vital to a person's grasp of a situation, and the positive effects of good advice are priceless.

We as human beings crave empathy. If it is lacking from a person's life, chances are they will be drawn to any hint of it from somebody else. Advice is a common form of empathy, as it is made up of an understanding of a certain situation and sympathy towards the problems it is causing a person. It displays a level of awareness that isn't found in other contexts. Being able to listen to advice from more than one person helps regardless of what is being said, because it reassures a person that they are not alone in dealing with their problem.

Even though advice is generally recieved from trusted individuals, it is important to be careful. When it comes from someone whose intentions are to help solve the issue, it can have a positive effect on the reciever. If it is doled out by someone whose sole intention is to benefit themselves, it can harm everyone involved. In order to avoid the latter, it is exceedingly important to rely on not just one person's opinion, but a wide variety of solutions to the problem. That way, instead of risking your emotions and livelihood on a single, possibly prejudiced opinion, you can analyze an array of opinions to find the ones that help you the most.

A month ago, I found out I was moving to another county. This meant that I would be away from the high school that I had applied to, and that because of the distance I wouldn't be able to see my friends again. It seemed like there was no successful end in sight, and that I had tried every possible solution with no outcome. I went to see a therapist to talk about this issue, and to seek some reassurance that I would be all right no matter where I went. Listening to one person, however, didn't help me feel any better. In the end, what helped was talking it through with my friends and listening to each and every one of their opinions on the matter. I didn't feel alone, as though I was the only one who cared about how this was affecting me, and I was able to look at the situation with fresh eyes. I was faced with solutions I hadn't even considered, because they were coming from people who could empathize with me in a different way.

Students already have a lot of school work to do and making them do this would be difficult. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a care provider for the family, or might have a job to do. This could also result in a lack of effort in certain things at school and at home.

If students have a lot of school work to do they could become stressed from not being able to get the work done. Students also might need to study and would not have time to do that, therefore, causing them to get a bad grade on it. This could also result in a bad grade on their report card, maybe even causing them to fail the class. If the students fail the class they will have to retake the class the next year, and if the students were already struggling with the class they would have to do it all over again causing stress in that way to. To much stress causes anxiety which can be harmful to the students self confidence, could make them sad or depressed, and many other problems.

Students might be a main provider for their family, taking care of family members, and paying for stuff the family needs. They might also be paying the bills or buying food and clothes for their family members. If students can't provide for their family they could become homeless or become sick. Might become in debt from not having someone work and make money for the family.

Students might also have a job to do and would not be able to work because they would not have time to work after school. They might also have a job so they can provide for their family or themselves. They might need the job to save up for college and schooling. If the students don't have the time to go to work they might get fired and they would not be making money to provide for family or themselves.

So in my opinion, I don't think this would be beneficial in any way to the students. This would be very stressful for the students and could also cause anxiety, even making the student become depressed if it is to stressful for them.

I think you should choose the first policy because students wouldn't really like the second. If you banned cell phones from school most students would bring them anyways. There would also be the issue with texting in class. And last but not least some parents need their children to have their cell phones with them when they are not at the house.

The reason that students would bring their cell phones to school if you banned them, would be just the simple fact that they are banned. Teenagers have an irrational desire to disobey rules. Banning cell phones would only encourage their defiance and give them that much more reason to bring their cell phones to school.

So not only would there be cell phones at school but students would text in class. This would be like adding insult to the injury. Now if we were allowed to use our cell phones in free time there would be no need to text in class. Meaning we would pay more attention to the teacher than to our phones.

Last some students have responsibilities that require that they have their phone with them. For example my bus drops me off in front of my little sister's elementary school. Everyday I call my mom to tell her I got my sister and that we're on our way home. I'm sure I'm not the only student that does this. So if i left my phone at home there would be the problem of my parents worrying weather or not i picked up my little sister and if we where already walking home.

Whether its struggle in class or things happening at home, they'll talk about it if the teacher can help but its best to keep those things to yourself and figure out how to deal with it or talk to a professional about those things. In some cases it may help, some people might become dimented or tormented by something on their mind and make rash discisions that harm themselves and others around them. The new technology would probably be very expensive and difficult to implament and gain the permission from parents and school officials who may be confused about it.

Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions like math or something? How can computers recognize facial movements humans use to express how we feel? Each human has their own smile and their own unique way of showing their emotions. How can a computer that doesn't have its own intelligence or will discern how a human actually feels? Humans can simply look at someone and tell how they are feeling on the surface but humans also hide things deep within their mind. Most people who trully hold someone dere and care about them can tell when a person is hiding something through more than just facial expressions and facial movements.

I think its nearly impossible for computers to access how a person feels at a moment, whether in class or physicalogical treatment.

The Electoral College is a process created by the founding fathers of America to choose a pesident by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I believe this is not a very effective process. I think that we should go to popular vote because it allows the citizens to have a vote and it is not up to people that alread run our country and it allows the president to be chosen fairly.

To begin with, the electoral college is not a good idea becuase it allows citizens to have a voice and it is not decided by people that already run oour country. If we resorted to this method, there might be a higher voter turn out because the citizens will feel that they really have a say in who runs the country. They won't think that if they vote for one person  and they win, that some lousy people in Congress will come in and make a different decision and go against the majority. This will make more and more people want to make a difference in the country. Then we will have more concered citizens and the U.S. will be a better all around country. As stated in Source two, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" That fact is why we should absolutly not have an electoral college. Then if we don't have an electoral college then we will have a higher voter turn out. Then after that, the good ole USA will be a better country than all of the other countries in the world ccombined except for our health and education. That is just one reason why should not have an electoral college.

Additionally, we should not have an electoral college because it will then allow us to chose the president fairly. With not having the electoral college vote on a president, it would make theh voting system more fair and not based on a few people. Then when people try and figure out if they will vote or not, they will think, ""hey, my vote does matter becuase there is no electoral college to spoil my vote!"" This would make for a much better run country becuase the citizens have a voice in the government. The only reason a citizen would not vote would be if they were critically injured or they didn't like any of the canidates. This is just one of the many reasons why we should get rid of the electoral college.

In conclusion, we should get rid of the eclectoral college because it would give the citizens more of a voice and it would make theh voting process more fair. This would make the government and the country run smoothly and a lot better than if we keep the electoral college.

If I ever am about to make a decision I would want peoples opinion, so I don't make a bad mistake. I think that is important to seek advice from others so you can learn from there mistake, have more ideas, and so you don't feel alone. Most people have already experienced what you have, which is why it is good to listen to them. If you ever have to need advice you should talk to somebody so they can help you get an idea of it.

People often need advice from someone they trust, but most of the time the people they trust have made mistakes too. If you listen to the mistake they have made you can fix it. You can use there advice to stop the things they did wrong. Lots of students need advice on things like which courses they should take for high school and middle school. If they ask and older sibling about which course to take in school they will know which are bad and good. If they know which courses are bad they will be able to not make the mistake their older sibling made. This why we should always at least listen to other people in case we make the same mistake as them.

Seeking for advice can also help list ideas about the advice you need. Most people only ask for advice because they are out of ideas and have no idea what to do. When you ask someone for their opinion on the decision your going to make, they will tell you everything your going to need to know. The person giving advice may have already experienced this situation and can help you make a pros and cons list. If you need advice on how to study for a test someone can help give you ideas on how to do that. Listing out ideas is a very good way to be able to see the good and bad things about the advice you need. Additionally, writing down ideas can also make sure you don't make a bad decision, because you are listing cons about the advice you need.

Many people need advice for a serious reason but feel like they will be alone. If you talk to someone it can really help. One example is, kids might want to talk about advice on how to make friends, but they feel embarrassed to talk about it. Another example is, many kids see this new trend going around school and want to do it too, but they don't want to ask their parents. They should always ask their parents first, so they can make the right decision. The student's parents would lead them into making the right decision and would list cons of that decision too. That is why seeking advice can always help. Even if students feel alone in their decision they should go to a trusted adult and make sure they are doing the right thing.

if people ever wants advice they usually ask someone for opinions on how they look, but they should also be able to ask advice on personal things to. Making big decisions on your on can lead to many bad situations. In conclusion, I think you should really seek advice from others because they can help you learn from their own mistake, list pros and cons, and help you feel like you are making the right decision.

I believe summer projects should be student-designed because they can be creative, enjoy time, and express what they have learned during their summer break.

To begin with, creativity reflects who you are. Student-designed summer projects would let the students think outside the box because it gives them an opportunity to create their own design. In my experience, many years ago, I was asked to work on a project but it had a certain format that I did not like. They had gave me a theme that I was not able to understand. I had to see it in their point of view and to be honest, it was difficult. I was not able to be creative nor express myself. That project had limited my creativeness and being creative is an essential step on working to complete a summer project.

Furthermore, Students could enjoy part of their summer time working on their summer project. They would have enough time to complete their project and would not be distracted by any classmate because everyone would be doing their own project. Therefore, assigning them to do their own summer project would give them enough time to complete it and enjoy part of their summer working on their own project.

In addition, day by day students learn something new. Other than working on their chores; they have time to go outdoors and explore new things during their summer break. Exploring helps you gather new ideas. Student-designed summer projects would be amazing because they could express what they have learned during their summer break. For instance, in 2019, I traveled to my parents birth country, Cuba. I had experienced something new. As a city girl, I had never seen an animal giving birth; in Cuba, I saw a cow giving birth; that was my first time seeing such thing. My grandfather had taught me the entire process. Another example, in 2018, I had turned fifteen years old; therefore during the summer I was able to take my learner's permit test. I went to take the test during the summer and fail it. I failed it because I did not take the time to study and thought I knew everything. I was wrong. In life you learn new things day by day. You should not do things in a rush; patience is important. When you learn new things it is also important to share with classmates and teachers because they can learn from it too.

People may argue that teachers know what they will teach the following year so they should designed the projects but what they do not consider is that students could express themselves and teach their teachers and classmates something new about their experience during their summer break. A hand full of students would feel pressured if they would have to work on a teacher-designed summer project.

In summary, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be able to express their creativity, enjoy time, and express what they have learned during their summer break to their teachers and classmates. I take this position and encourage every teacher to assign student-designed summer projects based on my reasons stated.",5,1619290000000.0,2807,3148,"In summary, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be able to express their creativity, enjoy time, and express what they have learned during their summer break to their teachers and classmates.

12520,5354114,30B617145AF6,train,"All over the world, major cities are trying to reduce their use of cars. From Germany, to France, to Columbia, and coming back to the US, people are limiting car use to reduce pollution, or live better, or even to save money. In some places, there is one day every year that doesn't allow cars. In other places, there are whole communities that dont allow cars year round.

In Germany, there is a community in named Vauban that doesnt allow cars unless you have the money to pay for a parking spot that is on the outskirts of town. The revolutionizing community makes peopl epay $40, 000 dollars just for one parking spot. This wonderful new place has reduced the amount of greenhouse gas produced in the last few years drastically, with 70% of the population not owning a car. This has encouraged many other countries to start somehting just like it.

The city of love may not be so lovely if it's so smoggy you can barely see. Paris was gaining so much air pollution from the amount of gas that was released from driving hta tthey put a ban on driving. This ban consisted of a few new rules to help prevent the smog from overpowering the beauty of the city. On Mondays, even numbered license plates were not allowed to use theie car for anything. This same rule applied to the odd numbered license plates on Tuesdays. This helped limit the amount of driving, in return limiting the amount of smog. Smog is created when the area has cold night weather and warm day weather, causing the air to trap car emission. Diesel can be a big contributer to this and is the main gas type in France. France favors diesel because of their taxing system, but it seems they don't care too much about their environment.

What would happen if every country had a day with no cars? The city of Bogota, Columbia has had a Day without cars once a year for quite a few years. Just recently, other Colubian cities have joined in and even Paraguay's captial has participated. What this day is supposed to do is promote the use of other types of transportation, for example; walking or biking. It also reduces smog and the amount of air pollution, in retalliation, improving the city. In Bogota, there is a $25 fine for those who do not participate in thsi environtmentally helpful day.

Although the amount of driving in the US has decreased since 2005, there is more we can do to help the situation. The average number of miles driven did peak in 2005 and drop from there, in return, dropping other statistics as well. As of April of 2013, the number of driven miles has dropped 9% below the peak, being the same as in January of 1995, says  Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. The roads have even become safer  due to the amount of young drivers dropping 23% between the years of 2001-2009. Even if the number of miles hadn't peaked, there still wouldn't be as many drivers on the road because of the recession. Americans couldn't afford to but cars due to the amount of money lost during that horrible time.

All through the world, people are trying to slowly save their environment by reducung car use. From one day to a whole year, everything helps to save our world. The German community of Vauban has made it nearly impossible to own a car. Paris, at one point, had to put restrictions on their driving. Columbia has an annual day of no cars. The US is working on lowering thier use of cars and dropping their average miles to help clear the air surrounding them. Even if it is walking from point A to point B, it helps the community and lowers air pollution.

With pollution in the air, it would cause people to have health problems. You probably couldnt breath as well as you should be able to. There's a chance you could end up getting sick, and dying. You'd pretty much be at risk for alot of things.

With the change in the economy, gas prices are up and down, and it's stressful trying to fill up your car having to spend so much money, when you have a family to take care of. Alot of people struggle with things like this situation, including bills. It wouldnt hurt to walk, or to take the bus to work. If you actually think about all the money you spend, using a car, you would realize that you could save much money by not having one. Maybe one day your car could start acting up and you would have to take it to the shop. Just imagine how much it would cost to fix it.

As the years past by, fewer cars are getting sold, and fewer people are getting their liscense.

98940,AAAOPP13416000024394,EC0A95423E9C,train,"My position on the driverless cars after reading this article is that I am against them. I am against them for many reasons. The first one being that if the driver is not ready to take over the wheel at any one point and time they could end up crashing the car or something else bad happening. My second reason is that why have a driverless car if it doesn't know how to navigate through road work or accidents on the road. After I am done telling you my side I will then tell you the reason I think the driverless cars can be a good thing and then finish it off with a conclusion.

My first reason for being against the driverless cars is that if the driver in the car isn't ready at all times to take over the wheel he or she could end up getting hurt or hurting someone else and it wouldn't even be thier fault. I think if it's a driverless car it should be a driverless car the person in the car should be able to be doing whatever they wawnt inside the car while the car drivers for them. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requres."" The human driver shouldn't have to be ready and any point and time i think the car should be able to handle everything road work, accidents anything.

My second reason is why have the driverless car if it doesn't know how to go through the road work or accidents. I think it should know how to go thru the road work, accidents, and all the traffic around the town or on the highways. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The car should know how to do this stuff on it's own or it's not really a driverless car. You still always have to be ready ""just in case"". So what if you need to do seomthing on the way to where ever your going and you cant do it because you have to be ready in case you need to take over the wheel.

But on the other side being for the driverless cars there are a lot of very good things that can come from using the driverless cars. One good thing about the car is that they have a lot of sensors and cameras on them. They also thought of a good way to make sure that the human driver in the car is prepared to take over. "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" There are also other options "" Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up display."" People were also thinking about a camera that watches the human driver watching the road so that they are remaining focused on the road at alll times.

In conclusion I have told you that I am against the driverless cars as of right now. I am against them because if the human driver in the driverless car is not ready to take over the wheel at anytime things could go wrong. Alsomy second reason is i think they should be able to steer through traffic, road work and accidents. But the cars heads-up stuff and doing the things to make sure the driver knows when they need to take over the wheel is good thing, also all the sensors and cameras are a very good thing to be on the car.",4,1621210000000.0,317,421,why have a driverless car if it doesn't know how to navigate through road work or accidents on the road. ,Claim,Claim 2,Effective,1621200000000.0,My position on the driverless cars after reading this article is that I am against them.

10152,5077271,AF47A210FE44,train,"There is a growing movement in lots of western countries to do less driving. In Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, a ""Day Without Cars"" has been established. It is an annual event where residents of the city are banned from using cars, and violators are fined. In Paris, residents were banned from using their vehicles for about week due to toxic emmisions, widely blamed on diesel fuel. In Germany, a development neighborhood called Vauban was created and has a strict policy on parking. Car-sized garages, and street parkin are banned, requiring residents to pay an extra 40000 dollars to purchase a parking space in the neighborhood. These ideals are even spreading to America.

Driving will emit toxins into the air, called greenhouse gases. These gases rise into the air, but are trapped by the ozone layer into our atmosphere and make the Earth warmer. This is a bad thing because the Arctic will start to melt and sea levels would rise. Now, vehicles are not the sole cause of this episdemic, but they are a large contributor. In Beijing, China it is said to be so polluted due to tailpipe emmisions that one would get sick if they were to go outside without a mask on to stop from breathing in the chemicals. In Paris, France the airborne toxins reached to a level just under the amount of chemicals in the air of Beijing. The city officials of Paris had to ban use of automobiles for about a week to rid the air of the poisons. If caught, vialotors were fined 22 euros (31 dollars American). This worked suprisingly well, and since the air cleared up, peoplpe are allowed to use their cars again. The Vauban in Germany is a neighborhood that has made it extremely difficult to own a vehicle. While vehicle ownership is permitted, car-sized garages are not included in the homes, and parking on the street is prohibited. If a resident wishes to park their vehicles, they must spend 40000 extra dollars along with the house for a space in a large garage at the edge of the development. This has all lead to cleaner air and happier, healthier people.

It is a well known fact the walking and cycling helps a person stay in shape. It keeps the heart flowing regularly, helps keep the lungs exercised, and keeps leg muscles strong ad healthy. If these ways of transportation are exhibited more often, and vehicles used less, we will not only have cleaner air, but a healthier human population. Walking can also help the brain work with the body to relieve stress, which puts people at less of a risk for heart disease. These factors are essential to producing a healthier population, which could let people live longer, and encourage them to do meaningful things that could benefit other parts of the world. The Internet has also been helpful in keeping people connected with friends and loved-ones without the need of driving to see them. It is possible to to center where you live around places to buy food and necessary supplies, as well as close to your workplace, all in walking distance. Even if that is not possible, finding a bus or public trnasportation route is always an option. It is less expensive than gasoline (tax included), car insurance, and any other expenses that might come with a privatly-owned vehicle. It is also less likely to get into an auto-accident when using public transportaion, and if it does happen it is not your responsibility to pay for the insurance deductible. All these factors and alternative transportaion methods can help to improve life for all people than it is with so many privately-owned vehicles.

The private owning of vehicles is convienient, but is still a hazard to the genearal health of our population. It poisons the air, and gives people an excuse to not walk or ride their bycyles as much, which can diminish their physical health. If we start to use privately owned vehicles less, however, it will promote the general welfare of our people. It is possible to cut the use of these vehicles short and preserve, even raise, our standards of living.

The author does a great job to describe venus as the Earth's ""twin"", but also as a dangerous planet that is not made for us. He brings up that no spacecraft has survived a landing for more than a few hours, that the atmosphere is 97% carbon doixide, that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, that the plantes surface has an average temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater as it is on the Earth. All these points convinced me that Venus is a planet that is not made for us to be on. Even if he brings up points why we should still go there it seems to me like it would make no common sense. He says that Venus once looked just like the Earth, but for me it doesn't matter how it once looked like because then we would first go into time traveling and that is not what this article is about. The author also brings up that there could be a survivable soulution by having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the landscapre. I don't think that this is a good idea, because it would take so much work and money just to see things that we can see without a human being there. He mentions that it probably wouldn't even help the scientists that much because we wouldn't be able to take samples of anything or even inspect the ground conditions. So I think that idea is a waste of money and unless there is a really good reason or something specific to look for we shouldn't do it. The author then mentions that researchers are looking for innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute knowledge over Venus. I think that is a good think to do but it can not be an option to send a human up there, because as long as you only send machines it is just money that you send up there, but with all the dangers it is stupid to send a human to Venus. He closes his article with the statement that we have to strive for new knowlegde beyond our Earth and I do agree with that but we have to look out what the dangers are and sometimes things are not possible, because we are very limited compared to the power of the universe.

So I think that we should keep looking for new innovations that can help us explore the universe but we have to accept that we are very small in a big universe and that not everything is possible for us because we are limited, while the universe is not.",4,1616520000000.0,1245,1393,"I don't think that this is a good idea, because it would take so much work and money just to see things that we can see without a human being there.

104196,AAAOPP13416000036282,097DBA99BCCA,train,"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This woman liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending her into a ditch. She liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this woman did get to her destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes.

24717,AAAXMP138200001639942144_OR,E3D6D79EA71F,train,"Summertime; it is every high schooler's favorite time of the year. Summer is supposed to be a time of warm, sunny days, and endless nights. Summer is also supposed to be a time of no teachers or school, only fun. However, for many students this is unfortunately not the case. It is very common for schools across America, and even across the world to impose mandatory summer projects on their students. These projects are designed to attempt and ensure that pupils retain their knowledge over break so they will be prepared for the upcoming school year. While they may be helpful, these projects certainly put a bit of a damper on those summer nights young folk so dearly regard. Difficult summer projects loom over restless teenagers like a tyrant. It becomes easy for anxiety to replace fun-loving spirit when teachers assign summer projects of boisterous proportions. Hard projects during a time of joy are also statistically less likely to take priority over their counterpart. This is why summer projects should be student-designed.

Student-designed projects would be an ideal choice for schools to to implement because they would allow students to feel more relaxed over the summer and enjoy their break. While most definitely a debatable topic, one is inclined to believe that students work extremely hard all year, and summertime is one of the few non-stressful moments they receive. If students could design their own projects it would lessen the pressure and anxiety of completing a task that they know could impact their future. If teachers were to give their students a rough set of requirements and allow them to creatively come up with a project, not only would they be much more enthusiastic about said project, but also much more likely to put in quality time to ensure their best work is put forth. Teenagers have some of the highest anxiety and depression rates of all age groups, and summertime is the one time of year where they are not pressured by constant school-work assigned by teachers. It is unfair and downright cruel to take this away from them.

Another reason student-designed projects are beneficial is that student-designed tasks have higher completion rates. This means that if teenagers are doing something that they want to do, it is much more likely to be completed than a task they deem boring. Not a single person on this beautiful planet of ours has the exact same interests. If students were allowed to create a piece based off of one of their interests, that piece is going to get done. When you allow for passion in a workplace, the results are outstanding. For example, a student who has an interest in photography could be assigned a summer project for their ecology class. This student could then create a portfolio of different types of plants and animals they encountered over the summer. To make this project educational, they could including a listing of the different species along with some details about their respective characteristics. A differing student in the same class who takes an interest in athletics, could take specimens of grasses and dirt from playing fields. From here, they could examine the biology and impact of the different types of sports fields on their respective sports.

In all, student-designed projects are a much smarter alternative to traditional teacher-designed projects. Allowing students to designate their own projects will lead to less stress, which results in a higher rate of project accomplishment as well as an increase in quality. Schools worldwide should allow for student-designed projects if they value passionate, complete, and quality work, furthermore if they value the happiness and well-being of their students. Any educational institution hopefully holds stake in all these virtues. In conclusion, schools that require summer work should only assign student-designed projects if they want success. ",5,1619310000000.0,2194,3248,"This means that if teenagers are doing something that they want to do, it is much more likely to be completed than a task they deem boring.

58970,AAATRP14318000616858,497ABA456900,train,"Is it crazy that now there is a Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotion in the world? Having a human emotion detected technology system is a bold positive choice in a classroom. A strong device that can read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because, teachers can get feed back on their students about certain assignments, peers can understand one another easier, and overall a better environment as a school. One device easily has three reasons why it would be a great investment for students and teachers.

Reason one, The Facial Action Coding System is positive for a classroom because, teachers can get feed back about certain assignments based off students emotions that the system detects. In the text Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, (par 6)"".

This been said, the evidence above is reactions you can get out of students and in the long run prevent. Not only does the system help the teachers by detecting these emotions, FACS will aslo benefit the students because the assignment or classroom function will most likely change due to the results.

Reason two, The Facial Action Coding System comes to benefit within peers themselves. The author states that "" Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (par 3)"". Getting assignments changed because boredom is a good thing; but, would it be a plus that peers know what one another also think in the classroom too? Muscular action units can easily change the way students look at one another in the classroom.

Reason three, The Facial Action Coding System can cause an overall significantly better open environment of many classrooms and even the whole school.

Also, Dr. Huang has noted that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (par 6)"". The notes above by Dr. Huang proove that not many people such as students to student or student to teacher share what they are thinking or feeling verbally. Would it be so bad for students and teachers to connect overall in the school and each and every classroom?

To gradually sum everything up, The Facial Action Coding System is an immensse benefit to students and teachers in the classroom. Technology that can read emotional expressions of students is valuable because, teachers can build feed back on their students about what is going on in the class, peers can understand one another easier through six basic emotions, and overall a better environment as a school can be promised. Mkaing faces and finding a device that can detect emotion can not only chnage things but open doors for science.

In conclusion, as the text states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them (par 9)."" This evidence above is the exact reason why FACS would be a outstanding investment for classrooms all over.

158160,AAAXMP138200002209792810_OR,07D52443B420,train,"Do you like to be given multiple good opinions instead of just one? Being given multiple opinions or viewpoints on a situation can be much more helpful than just one. The three reasons multiple opinions are better than just one is: You have more overall brain power and knowledge, a variety of opinions to use to benefit yourself, and the advice you are given may be incorrect, not helpful, or you may not like it; Therefore, having another opinion to lean on can be very useful when a scenario like this occurs.

The first reason I declared why multiple opinions are better is you gain more knowledge about how your peers or even the public views things. For example, just recently baseball season started up again, and I needed a new baseball bat. So, I began browsing online, reading reviews for each bat and seeing what comments or opinions people had about them. I asked my father and some of my teammates for their opinions on which bat to purchase. I asked not just whether the bat was good or bad, but what were some features they liked and some features they disliked about it. Every time I heard someones opinion, I acquired some of the information they told me. Using that I was able to make a smart and thought out decision on which baseball bat I should purchase.

Next, my second reason is talking to more people for their opinion on something means you will have either a mixed variety of opinions or a large number of people with the same opinion on something. Currently, across the world we are experiencing a global health crisis with the rapid spreading of the Coronavirus. Say for instance, you are head of the school board and you have to make a decision for your whole county as to whether or not our schools should be closed or not. The safety of our students, staff, and teachers relies on your decision. If you go around and collect everyone's opinions, you can combine them to come up with the best idea possible. Hearing as many people's opinions as you can and combining them is very beneficial when making decisions.

Lastly, my third and final reason to prove that having multiple people voice their opinions is better than just one is that you may not always find a persons advice helpful. If you ask one person for an opinion on something and you don't find it useful, you have nothing else to help you. On the other hand, if you have collected multiple opinions from multiple people, instead of just one, it doesn't matter if you don't like someones advice. You will still have more pieces of advice or opinions from different people to use for your benefit. That is why when asking for opinions, it is crucial to hear and collect one from multiple people, not just one person.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is very beneficial. Only hearing one opinion is alright, but hearing more than one is only that much better. My three reasons I have this claim are, a persons advice simply might not be helpful to you and having a variety of opinions that you can refer to and use for help is important. My last reason, with hearing more people's opinions you can acquire more knowledge, and in the end, knowledge is key.                ",4,1618170000000.0,2218,2707,"If you ask one person for an opinion on something and you don't find it useful, you have nothing else to help you.

The end talks about silicone carbide being tested over Venus's surface.

Venus is a challenging place to examine because it is really close to the sun which makes it hard to examine. According to paragraph 1 it says "" While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vanatage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" Venus is a hard planet to examine because of how close it is to the sun. None of the spacecraft's have survived the landing to Venus so no spaceships have went to Venus since. According to paragraph 2 it says "" Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" A spaceship has not went down on Venus because ofthe fails with the space creaft's.

Venus is way hotter than the temperatures is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth . According to paragraph 3 it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun."" Even though Mercury is closer to the sun Venus is so hot because of all the erupting valcanoes, earth strikes, and lightning strikes that may land on Venus's surface. Astronomers believe that Venus was once similar to Earth because of its features. Paragraph 4 says ""today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valley's mountains, and craters."" The Astronomers think since Venus looks similar to Earth because of the rocky, mountains, and valley's type of features.

Some people may think studying Venus isn't a worthy persuit because of how dangerous it could be for astronomers to examine it. People also may think coming up with devices to make scientists float over the surface is putting them in a position of getting hurt due to all the fails that have happened.

In conclusion studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it will make people more curious about the planet and it will also allow scientists to learn more about the planet and get a better insight up close of the planet rather than far away.

Driverless cars will be expensive to manufacture, which will be handed to the consumer in that driverless cars will be more expensive than regular cars. Since driverless cars still require an operator to monitor the enviornment, a person might as well just be driving the vehicle.

Driverless cars either require smarter roads, which will be extremely expensive to upgrade current roads and the cost of that would ultimately be handed down to taxpayers, or require expensive engineering which the cost of would be passed down to consumers.

Driverless vehicles still would require an operator which poses several issues. Drivers could become bored, and even if they had entertainment systems build into the car, drivers would then be distracted from the vehicle's environment in the case where the driver needed to take control of the vehicle. Even if the entertainment systems could shut themselves off in a moment's notice, drivers may not be in a state of mind that is prepared to operate a vehicle in an emergency situation.

The legal challenges facing driverless cars are also not worth fighting. Multitudes of laws would need to be changed in order for driverless cars to be legal.

As a result, a majority of the time spent at school during the first few weeks back need to be devoted to review before the new curriculum can begin.

In order to prevent this problem from occurring each year, some schools have started to require summer projects for their students as a way to review previous material while on break.

These summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more experience with education, teachers have the ability to make projects that are at an appropriate difficulty, and teachers know what information will be the most important to remember from the following year.

Most importantly, teachers should be the ones responsible for designing summer projects because the have had more experience with education.

For instance, all certified teachers have completed school through the twelfth grade, unlike the students they are teaching.

Since teachers have spent more time learning in school than their students, they have a better understanding of what their students will be required to learn.

With this knowledge, teachers can accurately tailor summer assignments help students retain knowledge that will be important in later years of schooling.

Along with this, most teachers in America, including my mother, need to have at a master's degree in education in order to be certified.

Although this is not all parts of America, anywhere from a few classes to a master's degree can be required before somebody can become a certified teacher.

With everything that they were forced to learn before they could receive their teaching degrees, teachers are the experts on how to lead a classroom along with create appropriate summer projects.

Hence why teachers should be the ones responsible for creating summer projects for their students.

With their extensive knowledge of the classroom, teachers are also more capable of creating the summer projects because they know how to make a project appropriately challenging for their students.

While it is true that individual students know which aspects of education are most difficult to them, teachers have the best idea of what the entire class needs improvement in.

Although not every student will benefit from completing a project that is meant to help the class as a whole retain knowledge over the summer, doing this can significantly help those who are struggling.

Having teachers create the summer projects also allows for those who are falling behind to catch back up with the rest of their piers before the next school year begins.

A specific example of this happened when students who previously took Geometry had to complete a summer packet before they could take Algebra 2 during the next school year.

The packet that was assigned matched the difficulty of the Algebra 2 class, so students were able to get a good idea of what was required of them during the next school year.

As a result of the packet being slightly more difficult than some anticipated, those who did some extra studying outside of the required assignment were more prepare to be on pace for the rest of the school year.

Therefore, teachers should be the ones responsible for creating summer projects for their students because teachers are more aware of the appropriate level of difficulty for a given class.

The final reason why teachers should be the ones creating summer projects for their students to complete is because teachers are aware of what information from the previous year will be important to retain for the next school year.

Although all information in school has a purpose, not all of it will reappear later on in school, depending on students' specializations.

Therefore, students who are all going to pursue different careers will likely take different sets of classes once they enter high school and college.

As a result, they will not be able to prepare for their specializations as effectively if they are required to create summer projects for themselves in order to retain any knowledge that might be needed in the future.

As a more specific example, the summer assignment that had to be completed before one could enter Pre-Calculus only included certain pieces of math that were learned in the past.

Despite learning about how to find the area and volume of many shapes in geometry, hardly any of that information showed up on this summer packet.

This was because the parts that did show up on the summer assignment became important building blocks for what students would learn in Pre-Calculus for the rest of the school year.

As a result, teachers should be the ones who create summer projects because of their knowledge of what information will be important to retain for later years of schooling.

All throughout childhood, students are heavily encourages to focus on their educations in order to obtain the best possible futures.

While it is good that students think for themselves while they are learning facts and equations in school buildings, giving students too much freedom in their education before they are properly educated could accidentally limit their ability to learn.

Therefore, summer projects should be constructed by teachers because teachers have the most experience with education, teachers are able to set summer assignments at an appropriate difficulty, and teachers know what information will be the most important to retain for future years of schooling.",5,1618680000000.0,2186,3491,"While it is true that individual students know which aspects of education are most difficult to them, teachers have the best idea of what the entire class needs improvement in.

167056,AAAXMP138200002012052810_OR,C97DFE0AC3C4,train,"In everyday life, you have to make choices. These choices vary from a small problem, to a situation where you can't handle it by yourself. Most time it isn't easy, so you go to get advice from our friends, family, co workers, or teachers. Seeking multiple opinions from more than one person makes you choose better choices because you a get a variety of options and opinions, you get advice on how to make your own choices, and people that are wiser then you tend to giver better advice from their own personal experiences.

When you get a variety of opinions from many people you have a higher chance of making better choices. This is because when you get different inputs, you can choose the advice that fits appropriately with your specific situation. For example, if you are in a hard situation at work, and you need to make a finical situation, your co workers, parents, grandparents, and younger siblings will have completely different answers. Your parents, co workers, grandparents have had to work a job either in the past or in the present, meaning from experience they will have a variety of opinions. They would have different job expireneces, so everyone answers will be different and unique from one another. With the variety of options you are given, you can choose the choice that suits your situation the best. With their input, your choice option is better than when they did not contribute to your problem.

In some circumstances when you receive advice from someone, you come up with your own solution while discussing with them. In this case, you make a better choice because you came up with your own solution and you know how to handle the situation correctly. An example could be when you are in a tough situations with friends, for instance you get in a fight or your can not compromise with a solution, you would most likely talk with your parents or another friend. While discussing with them you are participating with them as well while trying to think of an appropriate solution to your problem. They constantly give you ideas that just don't fit in with your situation. After a long time of thinking over your problem with your friend, you can get frustrated easly because all you want is the fight to be over. Once your state of mind is like that, it just spits out ideas of its own, and that is when you come up with your own solution. Thanks to your family and friends multiple opinions and options trying to help you out as much as they could, you come up with your own solution to your problem.

The final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help you make better choices is because some people, most likely older folks, are wiser and have more experience in difficult life situations. Your situations could vary from not doing well academically, to a heart break, or to financial difficulties. All these things have happened to your parents or grandparents. Your wiser adults would gladly give you advice from their personal experiences, and they will give your a wide variety of choices. They have more experience than the younger generation meaning there options are most likely the best options to choose. Having a wiser adult guide you through life to help you make better choices is a big advantage in the future for your self. You would thank them for helping you be a better person by choosing the best choices.

In conclusion, when you are in a tough situation, multiple opinions can help you make the best choice possible. Taking the advice that people give you and seeing if it can be applied to your problem helps with any situation. When you listen to people that want to help you out, the outcome can be that you get a variety of options and opinions, you get advice on how to make your own choices, and people that are wiser that you could help you out from their personal experiences. The next time you can possible get out of a problem, seek multiple options, it will help you in the long run.  ",5,1617740000000.0,524,627,"

40497,AAAXMP138200001511492850_OR,127E7F587FBD,train,"Determined, I sprinted across the soccer field to get open for a pass. My teammate was pushing the ball towards the opposing team's goal and I wanted to ensure that we would score. I ran right past two or three defenders and called for the ball. He kicked me the perfect pass right through the middle of their defense. During those two seconds the ball soared over to me, all I could think about was scoring that goal. Once the ball reached me I chested the ball in order to control it, then fired a shot straight into the bottom right corner of the net! The score was now 2-1 with us in the lead, late in the second half. I smiled and silently thanked my parents for making me play this sport. Thanks to this experience, I have been driven to write an essay regarding extracurricular activities. Recently, our principal has decided to make extracurricular activities required. He states that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While not everybody is on board yet, yes, it is a good idea to require extracurricular activities in schools.

First of all, extracurricular activities are beneficial to most people. A survey given to schools across Generic_City that was made by the county's school board asked students about their extracurricular activities. Three questions in the survey particularly stand out. The first of the three was whether or not students enjoy their extracurricular activities. The second one was whether or not students learned something from them, and the last one was if students would recommend their activity to other students in the school. The answers to the first and second were both 92% yes, and the third one was 81% yes. Therefore showing that extracurricular activities can be an important and enjoyable part of your life. They bring new and fun learning points to your life rather than old and boring school based curriculum that you might not even use for the rest of your life. There is absolutely no reason why students shouldn't participate in an extracurricular activity

Furthermore, there is something for everyone. When I was in the 6th grade, way back in the day, I had a strange friend group. hardly anybody shared the same interests. I liked to run, and my buddy Generic_Name liked to sit back and watch TV, but we were somehow best buds!

When our school started introducing some after school activities, every single one of my friends was in a different activity. I was in the running club, Generic_Name was in movie analysis, Generic_Name was in Lego club, and Generic_Name was in board games. Not one person was disappointed with their activity. This proves that there are options for everybody. Every student will have something that interests them which leads to them enjoying the activity, and learning from it.

Most importantly, these extracurricular activities can lead to a career choice. In an interview with principal Generic_Name of Generic_School, Generic_Name states: ""Extracurricular activities are very important to me as a principal. We offer our students a wide variety of clubs such as writing club, sports analysis club, biology, chemistry, and history, hoping to spark interest in these students for their future career choices.""

This quote by Principal Generic_Name shows that extracurricular activities are not just used for fun and games. They are there to inspire students. To get them ready for their future.

If students don't learn what they want to do in life how will they ever be successful? That alone is important enough to make extracurricular activities required.

On the other hand, some people believe it shouldn't be required to do some sort of extracurricular activity because they would take up unnecessary time. A survey was given to parents of Generic_City Public School students, asking if they were unhappy about how much time their children take up doing their extracurricular activities. Out of 128 responses 53% said yes, they are unhappy with the amount of time their child is taking doing his or her extracurricular activities. Sure, this is a good point. However, the activities are not meant for the parents. They are meant for the students. Going back to the first survey mentioned; the one given to Generic_City students; out of 2243 responses, 96% of students say their activities are worth while. Almost every single student thought their activities were worth their time. If students believe their activities don't take up too much time, why not require them? If their parents are unhappy that should not change anything because these activities are meant to benefit students, not their parents.

All in all, we need our extracurricular activities, and to make them required is a great idea. It is fun for the students, It's beneficial, it's a good learning experience, and it's a good way to give students ideas for their career. If you want to help make schools require extracurricular activities, you can send an email to your principal asking to require them. If you want to help out in different ways, go ahead and form a club for your school! It could be anything that interests you, or anything you want to inform others on. It's up to you.

Students should be able to choose whether or not to participate in activities that are extracurricular. Extra curricular activities are activities that are extra, not required. Requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities should not be done because activities should not be forced, students already spend eight hours a day at school, and don't have the time or transportation.

Extracurricular activities are activities that are supposed to be extra. Having to require that all students do one, is taking away the definition of the word. Activities should be done of free will, not by force. Students may be stressed having to do something that they did not want to do or do not even care about. Extracurricular activities are out there for people who want to do them, not for those who do not want to. Students participating in something that do not enjoy or care about, is apathy. They do not care about the activity which causes a negative aura around those who do care about the activity.

Students on average spend eight hours a day at school, five days a week for about eight to nine months with holidays included. Eight hours in one thirds of a day, leaving only about sixteen hours left. Another eight of those hours goes to sleep and the rest to free time. Out of those eight hours of free time, one or more of them goes to preparing for school, then another for homework, and some for chores. After calculating it, in truth students only have about four or less hours of free time to themselves. Like all people, students want to be able to do what they want. They have dreams and goals that they want to achieve, but it does not mean that it is school related. Requiring students to take part in extracurricular activities that they do not want to do is not justified. Students deserve to enjoy themselves and have free time. They work hard on assignments at school and learn, they deserve a break. It doesn't just apply to the students, teachers too, have time that they want to spend on other things. In order for such extracurricular activities to work, a teacher will be required as a monitor.

In order for students to participate in extracurricular activities, students need transportation. Some schools do offer transportation, although it is only on certain days. Many extracurricular activities require students to show up after school, some on days that there might not be the transportation that they need. Finding someone to take you to school or where the extracurricular activity can take time.

Force, time, and transportation are some of the reasons on why extracurricular activities should not be required. Instead, they can be made as an extra credit grade, which will make more students want to do them.

Distance learning is a new option for students that schools are thinking about adopting. One side to this argument says this will be a beneficial thing for students. However, other's think that this will hurt students more than it will help them. Schools should allow distance learning as an opportunity for students because: it'll teach students how to work independently, they won't have to deal with social pressures, and it gives them the opportunity to prove themselves.

One of the many benefits to distance learning is it gives more chances for independent working. Also, it gives people more of an ability to work efficiently by themselves. For example, it lets students work on their own time. In addition, it also allows teachers to rely less on their students. Secondly, it teaches students work ethic. Working independently teaches them how to work effectively on their own. Moreover, it also helps people learn an abundance of skills that can be applied into the workplace. Finally, working by oneself teaches people many important things that schools can't.

Not only does it teach independent working, but it removes the societal pressures that come from a school setting. With distance learning, it removes the bad peer pressure. First off, it gets rid of the bad distractions. Secondly, it encourages the benefits of completing work. Furthermore, it relieves the stress of performance. For example, it allows students to focus more on the work to be done, and not on how they look. In addition, it removes the feelings of having to do better than others in order to succeed. Distance learning doesn't put students under standards of performance, unlike a school setting does.

Lastly, it gives students an opportunity to prove themselves. It allow students to show themselves that they have what it takes to succeed. For example, it builds confidence that one can do do more than they think they can. Also, It helps build self-confidence in oneself. Not only does it help self, but it also impresses colleges as well. In proving that students can complete certain tasks efficiently and effectively, it shows that they have what it takes for the next step. In addition, it builds trust in others that they can finish what they start. In conclusion, the benefits to this are life changing.

Distance learning is a new opportunity for schools and students. It teaches people how to work independently and not to rely solely on others. Also, it removes bad societal pressures that arise from peers in a school setting. Furthermore, it gives people the opportunity to not only prove it to others that they can work but to themselves as well.

Your mind races you think of all the things you could do, you think of chess club or the football team. That is what happened to me and if I am being honest i think it is a good idea, to have students participate in something and not just sit around, i think it is a good idea because it keeps students healthy and active.

There are many sports, I even play play a few myself such as baseball, swim team and football. if not a sport than a student can join a club such as decorating a yearbook or or act as a member on a student council which is very important if a student wanted to pursue a career in the government.

activities such as these are very important for brain development and creating social skills. even if you despise doing activities such as these there are so many options they are also very good for making friends, some of my closest friends i have met through base ball or swim team.

But i understand how some people can not like these things they could have social anxieties or maybe they are not good at sports i understand but having them be required to do such a thing i think is good. giving people an excuse to go outside and actually do something like hangout with friends or be an active member of the community is awesome and more people should do that. or just act in there school as someone who dose something for the community.

That is why people should do things like play sports or help out in their community is it look good on your resume for colleges and con help you if you need references for jobs in the future that is one of the many reasons i agree and i think you should to because even if you dont like sports or clubs or thing like that they are still very important.

I have thought about your decision on whether or not students have to perform community service, and although community service is great, I believe that students should make their own decision. After all it is their time and they should choose what they want to do with it, some kids may want to perform the community service but some may want to be with their friends or simply doing another activity. Also take in mind that some kids are really unable to perform community service because they may have prior commitments and you can't just make them abandon that activity because it may be something that they absolutely have to do. You also may not know that some kids' parents may be working at that time so they must take care of their siblings. Community service is great and all but you have to take in mind that there may be a priority greater to some students than having to volunteer their time towards the community when they have other more important things to do. For some it will be their choice not to get involved helping the community be a better place but for others you cannot just simply require them to have to volunteer their time to not do something that would take away from their time that they may have needed to do something more important to themseves. So I tell you do not make community service a requirement for your school because there may be many people that cannot give their time to this cause.

Thank you for letting me have just a moment of your time and thank you for listening and taking my thoughts to mind. I hope this makes a great impact on your decision and once again, Thanks!

When you ask more than one person for advice, I do believe that you will make better choices, because it can give you a gigantic understanding of other peoples opinions, it can help you for the rest of your life, and it can help others succeed in life too.

Getting to know others opinions can help you see the situation from a different perspective. In result, you can pick through them and find the one that sounds the best for the situation. Although, if there is a bunch of people saying different things it can be hard to choose the best advice, but if people are saying the same thing than that is probably the best advice.

Knowing good advice could help you for the rest of your life. As a result it could help you get through life easier. It could also prevent stress, because if your in a situation that you have already been in, then you would already know what to do in that situation. Some advice could help you everyday like someone giving you advice on how to brush your teeth or what is a good way to put in contacts.

Good advice could be passed down for sentries and could help a lot of people. Telling someone good advice can make it go into a loop of better choices.

Traditionally, students go to a public/private school for their education but some schools have introduced distance learning, learning at home through online or video conferencing, as an option for students to continue to attend classes from home. Distance learning positively impacts students by allowing them to not miss school if they are ill and to get access to class options that would not have been available to them at traditional public/private school.

Distance learning allows the student to not miss instruction because of an illness. In traditional school, if you are ill you have to miss a day or even a couple of days in order to feel better. Students are advised to not go to traditional public/private school while they are sick because they could get others sick, but this would not be the case if the student was enrolled in distance learning as they would not directly be interacting with other students and teachers.

Traditional public/private schools are limited in the amount of classes that they can offer therefore, limits the student on classes they can enroll in and limits the amount of experience the student would have in the career they are interested in pursuing. Depending on which distance learning program a student is enrolled in, they may have more options as to what classes they take. This could help the student to take classes that interest them and helps them to gain experience in their potential career field.

Although distance learning limits the amount of school the student would miss from illnesses and potentially provides a wider variety of classes for a student, distance learning does not allow the student to have the social aspect that traditional school has. In traditional public/private school, a student would interact with many people from classmates to teachers. This interaction helps build social skills that will help the student later on in their careers and in life. Distance learning offers the student to have more free time throughout the day due to shorter classes and not having the immense amount of wasted time that traditional public/private schools have. The student could use this extra free time to volunteer, get a job or participate in extracurricular activities, which would eliminate the lack of social interaction.

Distance learning positively impacts students by allowing them to not miss school if they are ill and to get access to class options that would not have been available to them at traditional public/private school. Although distance learning limits the amount of social interaction a student may have, distance learning does offer a student more free time to participate in extracurricular activities, get a job or volunteer.

For example, when you are in need of someone in a difficult situation, you probably talk to more than one person to see who has the best answer to your problem. I think seeking multiple opinions is better because it gives you a choice on what you want to do,you have another piece of advice that you can rely on, and it can help you see that the first opinion does not make any sense

First, if you get more than one opinion you get to choose what you feel is the best option for your problem. I remember when i was young i only ever asked one person for advice and that was my mom. But she didnt always have the best advice and i paid the price for that one time. I was really small then and i asked my mom if i could play tackle football and she said that i could. but I was way too small back then so i broke my leg on my first play. but if i asked for another opinion i probably would've played one more season of flag football.

Next, if you get more than one opinion, you have another piece of advice that you can rely on. If you have a opinion that sounds really bad but you have another opinion that sounds really good, you go with the good advice. but if you never asked for another opinion, and you just went with the first, really bad option, it could mess up something for you. say you were going to marry a girl but you mom said not to because she isnt rich enough, but you really love her so you ask your dad and he says marry her, you'd probably go with your dads opinion because you love her so much. but if you never got your dads opinion, you wouldnt be marrying her because your mom does not like her.

Finally, if you get more than one opinion, it could help make you see that the first opinion does not make any sense at all. If you're a student having trouble with a subject, and you ask another student for advice on what to do, and you're not sure that what they said is true and you go ask the teacher and what the teacher said to do makes way more sense, you go with what the teacher said. But again, if you had'nt asked for that second opinion, you would've gotton all of that subject wrong.

When people ask for advice they often talk to more than one person.

I believe this new technology could become a great tool. The teachers when they ask a student if he/she understand their face tell it all. This can also help teacher who at times don't know how a student feels and relate with the student. If the students aren't into a lesson the teacher know so she maybe come in at a different point of veiw. This would not only be a good tool but it could make people better at their jobs.

This new technology can be use in the court. When people lie they put on a different face with the kind of tool the courts can detect if someone telling a lie.

99417,AAAOPP13416000016616,1A23AD385E6D,train,"Man kind has always invisioned a magical future. A future that includes time travel, flying, and driverless cars. The basis for a plethora of T.V. shows and movies has been based on these very ideas. What if one idea of this imagined future was closer than thought possible? Driverless cars are no longer an idea for the future. Driverless cars have become an idea of the present. In paragraph 2, it states that since 2009, Google has had cars developed that can drive themselves under certain conditions. Driverless cars may face some difficulties, but the pros do outway the cons. I believe that driverless cars should be made because they allow safe multitasking for the driver, give safer conditions while driving, and set the bar higher for future technological goals.

The cars deemed as the future allow endless possiblities for productiveness with the driver. The self driving cars let the driver catch up on paperwork, or let them make an important call. The cars could also just be nice for a relaxation time. This wouldn't be considered a safety hazard because manufacturers working on this driverless car are involving notifications for when the driver is needed. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager, states how they would deal with difficulties involving this in paragraph 8. BMW is working on making driving interesting, so that the driver wouldn't just get bored as the car drives itself. Some manufacturers are working on bringing in display boards or some type of information system to make it interesting. But when the driver is needed in tough conditions, the displays are turned off and the driver is notified when needed. Every concern is listed with a solution in paragraph 8.

The car overall becomes safer, rather than just the action of multitasking. With regular cars, the driver has to keep eye for danger themselves. With the driverless car, it is involved that the car informs the driver when they are needed or if a rough situation is ahead. The driver would be notified by some type of sensor. The sensors have been around since as early as the 1980s, as stated by paragraph 5. The sensors in the car can cause brakes to be applied and can reduce power from the engine. The car would have a greater response and greater control than a human driver ever could. Paragraph 5 tells about the sensors and tells about how improvements for sensors are still underway to this day. In paragraph 7, it states that a driver can take control also, and will be needed in tough situations. Drivers can still have a sense of control over their car.

Driverless cars also inspire others to shoot for high goals in the technological field. Every technological advance has been inspired by some other tehcnological discovery. Just recently, a new fad had come along called hover boards. But these hover boards weren't the ones seen in the Back to the Future franchise, these hoverboards were inspired by them, but didn't exactly hover. Still, the creators of this type of hover board were inspired from a different technological idea. Great strides in technology or ideas for technology make us want to move further. In paragraph 6, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of the Google car project, stated, ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" His basic idea, was that as time went on and technology got intensely better, so did the technological ideas. These self driving cars could inspire even more magnificent ideas for the future.

In conclusion, these cars not only let the driver mutlitask safely, they just in general make driving safer. These cars could inspire the greatest invention in history. Technology is based off of other technology. The pros for self driving cars outway the cons for a plethora of reasons. Driverless cars are closer than one thinks, and are safer than one thinks. In paragraph 10, it states that Tesla has a release date for 2016 for the driverless car and Nissan plans to have cars that are driverless by 2020.

86401,2171004648,FC01486A3507,train,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard about the new academic rule, requiring a B average to play a school sport. For many kids a B average is tough to come up with especially for those are involved in other activities outside of school. You must realize that we are kids and coming up with a B average with all the homework and tests and quizzes that our teachers give is are really hard to complete, along with other extra-curricular activities and other athletics we are associated with.

Being part of an athletic team means a lot to a kid like me. Being able to participate in our interests and the things we enjoy and love to do is just wonderful. If you are going to take that away from many kids, then a lot of kids may proceed to do even worse. That is definitely not what you want. I think that the C average was fine the way it was and is a good academic goal for some of us.

I think many other kids would be able to come up with a B average if you told your teachers to cut down on the homework and quizzes somewhat. Being part of other athletic team and social groups does not give me much time to do my homework. Kids should be able to experience the 'right kind of childhood' and with all this homework and tests, I am staying up until at least eleven o' clock every night trying to complete my homework or studying for a test. To me, eleven o'clock on a school night is way to late, which is leaving me tired every day and not being able to perform to my full potential.

You might say that school is more important than anything else and that if we do not have enough time to do our homework, that we should just quit, or stop attending those extra activities. Quitting those other activities would leave our middle school careers with nothing but homework and studying. Doing homework and studying all day long will bore your students and eventually most of us will stop completing our tasks assigned. As kids, free time is very valuable to us. Participating in other activities makes us well-rounded students and most importantly 'who we are'.

Lastly, I think this rule is a little to strict. I think this because not only are we assigned a great amount of work, some of us are learning harder criteria than others and that is definitely not fair. Overall, I believe what we are given is tough and a challenge to complete. Those are only a few reason why I believe you should re-think about that rule change. I hope you put great thought into even possibly changing this rule back to the way it was and in my mind should be. Thank you.

There is a phrase that goes as follows, curiousity killed the cat, and I believe that our curiousity will provide fatal outcomes in the future with so called, driveless cars. The author of the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming."" provides some key points on why driveless cars may never be completly driveless and some problems they might provide as well, for example the author states about how in some situations human skill may be required, as well as how the law doesn't fully approve of so called driveless cars and even if it did many laws would have to be placed just in case there may be some faults in the technology and etc.

One problem with the so called driveless cars is the fact that human skill may be required in certain situations. For example, the author talks about how in certain situations such as traffic jams, work sites, and around accidents human skill may be required. If human skill may be needed then the purpose of driveless cars is defeated. What would be the point of having a driveless car if you just had to sit there and wait for your turn to drive the car out of a challenging situation. That doesn't sound very driveless to me.

Another problem driveless cars impose invlolves the law. For example the article states that most driving laws focus on keeping everyone safe, and they all agree the best way to do that is to have alert drivers at the wheel. Many laws would have to be put into place to even allow the full use of so called, driveless cars. How would a driveless car react to a regular automobile passing them on a highway? Even if driveless cars did become legal and functional not everyone would be running to buy them. As well, whose fault would it be if the technology some how fails? Technology doesn't always work, and with lives being at immediate risk of a technological fail and more, the chances of the law allowing it seems very low.

To conclude, driveless cars would not be safe and or even driveless. The need for an active and alert driver in a driveless car would defeat the purpose. As well, the law and it's laws would have to change a lot to provide the safest way of travel using the so called, driveless cars.

Students should not be forced to have to engage in extracurricular activities because some kids might have trouble with time management. Having to do something else other that school could be very difficult for them. Also parents might not want their child to have to participate in other activities other than school because their child could get distracted.

Another reason of why I disagree with the principals decision is it should not be his or her choice if the child should have to engage in a extracurricular activity that choice should be made by the child or the childs parents only.

Forcing students to do some type of activity besides school should not be allowed because what if that child does not have a ride home and the school does not provide transportation. Having to do sports or student council and yearbook along with school could put a load of stress on that child which is never good for a kids mental health. I understand that the principal just wants his or her students to have a healthy life but the choice of if students should be forced to have to participate in an extracurricular activity should not be made by them.

In conclusion I hope that my principal rethinks their decision about forcing kids to participate in extracurricular activities. I also hope that I was able to influence you to also believe that kids should not have to participate in extracurricular activities.                ",3,1616430000000.0,998,1180,Forcing students to do some type of activity besides school should not be allowed because what if that child does not have a ride home and the school does not provide transportation. ,Claim,Claim 3,Adequate,1616430000000.0,I disagree with my principal's decision and I am going to explain why you should too.,Position,Virginia,Independent,,Mandatory extracurricular activities,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I believe that we should be aloud to have phones during lunch because well people have them out anyway. Were also kids we love to text and sometimes talk to our parents or grandparents or someone like that. Some students may also be shy to talk to the people who go to our school. Its just something that takes some time to find out

I also agree that we shouldn't because well harassment could go on or people could tell there friends to bring a gun or something to school or even drugs. Yea it is fun to have our phones out but we don't need to focus our lives on phones some people around the countrys aren't lucky enough to have phones.

I say people shouldn't waist there time on phones get out and do something. There are allot of people who cant move a bone in there body we should be thankful we can. God gave us gifts one of my gifts is softball and gymnastics those sports i love doing but you cant do them with a phone in your hand. well you could but it would be hard of dangerous.

Phones have got ton me in trouble may many of times. One year i was playing softball worming up the pitchers arm for the game i didn't have any gear on not even a face mask to protect my face well my phone rang in my pocket and i was so exited to see what it was. So i looked at the text well the pitcher didn't know that at the time she pitched it and it hit me right in the eye knocked off my glasses and gave me a black eye.

So, i mean there are many good things about it and many bad things you just have to be smart about what you do. Many people already text in school but teachers done know that and yes there has been rude comets on them but its part of life.

You are our principal and we respect you, you've made great disitions for us just keep shooting them out at us were ready for you.

Why should people use their phones if they are operating a vehicle? It is dangerous for someone driving a vehicle to use their phones because it can cause an accident. People should not use their phones while driving. People use their phones to text,answer phone calls,and to make plans. You can not do two things at once everybody uses their phones instead of paying attention to the road. You should always drive safe and make sure you stop at every traffic light. You should have drive at the speed limit. No car should ever go 100mph on the interstate or on a busy street. It will be hard to stop your car at a red light if you are going 100 mph. You will most likely get pulled over or get into a car accident if going that fast.

One reason you should not use your phone while driving is texting. One day you can be driving your car and you will get a text message from someone. That person will look at their phone and pick it up and start texting back. They will be all into their phone and not paying attention to the road. He or she will be trying to text back and pay attention to their phone and the road at the same time. They can be driving and slam on the brakes and the car behind them can hit them from behind and that caused an accident all because that person was trying to text someone back. You should not text and drive at all. That is so dangerous if you drive looking at your phone. Its alot of things that can happen when you are using your phone while driving vehicle. If you want to be on the phone with somebody while driving car you should get some where you can stick your phone in and talk to that person. You can also get pulled over by the police when using your phone while driving.

Picking up your phone to answer a phone call could also be dangerous. If you have to answer a phone call you should pull to the side of the road or wait to call that person back. Driving with your phone in you hand is dangerous because you will be busy trying to answer a phone call and not looking at the road. Your best option is to pull to the side of the road and answer the phone instead of driving with it in your hand. You can also get some earbuds to put in your ear so you won't have to answer the phone with your hand. Holding a phone or tablet in your hand while driving is so dangerous. You can have a phone is your hand but you will try to turn the steering wheel and you will not make a perfect turn. So it is best for you to not have no phone in your hand. If you are driving a car and somebody behind you on their phone. Both of you people will get to a traffic light and the light will be red and you and the person will slam on brakes and most likely you will hit another car and the car behind you will hit your car. It will be your fault that you were on your phone and not paying attention to the road. Then you will most likely go to jail if that person you hit die. Depending on how bad that person is hurting you can get like 5 years in jail probably more than that. Everybody in this world need to just stop texting and driving.

Some people use their phones and look up at the road at the same time that is dangerous to.

Nobody should make plans while driving a vehicle. Some people make plans while on the phone with someone or typing it in their notes so they won't forget. When making plans you should do that while you are at home. Making plans while driving a car can make you not focus on driving because you are trying to make plans. For example, you and a friend is in the car your friend is talking to you about going somewhere and you are trying to listen to what she is saying and focus on driving that is not safe at all. Your friend should wait until you stop somewhere to make plans. Talking while driving is not safe but you can talk and drive at the same time. When you are in the car with somebody you should just be focusing and not talking . When you in your car you should not play no loud music because you need to make sure you can hear surroundings. Like if you are in your car you might hear a police siren but your music is to loud so you wont be able to hear the siren. Say you are in the car with your friend and she try to show you a fight that happened at your school and you are driving a car you looking at the fight not paying attention to the road and you crash. It's your fault that you was looking at the phone and not paying attention to the road.

In conclusion,nobody should use their phone while driving. It is dangerous for you to text and drive. It is also illegal for you to use your phone while driving a vehicle. It's always safe for you to pull over to answer a phone if it is an emergency or to text someone back. No one should text and drive because that can ruin someone's life. All you have to do is pay attention to the road and you can be safe. Don't try to look at your phone and drive a car at the same time         ",5,1622650000000.0,188,236,People should not use their phones while driving ,Position,Position 1,Adequate,,,,Georgia Virtual,Independent,,Phones and driving,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

For students nowadays, assignments that are to be done at home may as well be free points due to the prevalence of cheating. The home environment and school assignments do not mix. Although some might believe otherwise, social development, keeping students engaged, and cheating prove that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Social interactions are instrumental in the development of young people and help create productive members of society. Most, if not all, of these interactions between young students occur in the school environment. This connection between consistent social interactions and strong social abilities shows the importance of having an in-person education. While some might say that school is not required for the development of young adults into socially able adults, it is the most common form of consistent social exposure for young people.

It is apparent that the environment that school provides is important in maintaining students' attentiveness and reception to education. Students are more likely to preform well in the school environment than the one at home due to excess distractions. It is for that reason that students should not be given the option to receive and education in an environment outside of school. Some may claim that it is possible to create a viable learning environment at home, but it is unlikely that many would follow the strict lifestyle needed for the disciplined environment required for meaningful education.

The introduction of modern technology into education brought with it the prevalence of cheating. Students nowadays can already find online the answers to almost any assignment they receive, so giving them their entire education at home, where no limit on cheating exists, would certainly decrease the legitimacy of their work. Some may claim the opposite, saying that it is important to rely on the integrity of students to give them a sense of trust and independence. This is based in fallacy, however, because those principles are developed through structured education, which cannot be found in stay-at-home schooling.

It is important for students to stay in education because of the social, educational, and honesty benefits that come from school. In the future, students should maintain their public schooling system due to the aforementioned benefits. In the past, education in school has proven to be effective in developing adequate social and learning skills in students. A call to action on the issue of online classes versus in-school classes could be the introduction of legislature that requires students to attend school in person rather than online.",5,1621830000000.0,1187,1431,Students are more likely to preform well in the school environment than the one at home due to excess distractions.

Wouldn't it be nice to know a lot of them held similar interests in comparison to you? Studies show that friendships tend to last longer when you're around people who like things that you like. I believe that the principal's decision to have all of the students participate in an extracurricular activity would be a good idea because it can help students learn to organize their time, help them find people with similar interests to make friends, and it could physically, and mentally, strengthen the students.

In order for one to survive as an adult, you must learn to organize your time. When doing extracurricular activities, because it is outside of school (most of the time) it is helpful to know when you have things planned. This way, a student could get work done for school, go to baseball practice, and still have time to go shopping with their friends. As an adult, you must schedule meetings, or interviews for jobs. Doing extracurricular activities would be great for the students; After all, it could help them learn to organize time for the future.

However, time isn't the most important subject when it comes to these activities. I believe that doing extracurricular activities would help students find their ""people"". I personally have done multiple sports, and currently have many interests such as, band, art, and swim. I have found that within these interests, I have made more friends than I could have if I didn't express them. I have held onto more relationships that date back to when we met in something that we liked, rather than something we didn't. Your ""people"" could also end up leaning you in the direction of different jobs. They could help you find things that you like, because they like the same things.

Finally, I believe that it could physically, and mentally strengthen the students who participate in such activities. When doing sports, I can confirm that you will most definitely become more physically able if you happen to like the sport. If you'd prefer to work in a group, by doing things such as band, yearbook, or student council, colleges might look to accepting you because you have the mental stability to work in a group. This could help the students with in-school activities such as projects.

I believe that the principal's decision to have all of the students participate in an extracurricular activity would be good because it can help students learn to organize their time, find people with similar interests to make friends, and it could physically, and mentally, strengthen the students.

I'm sure that would be majority of upper classmen students. I can admit I've have been several of times, In my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. Students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class.

School can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. Then when the teacher explains it to you , If you don't understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. This can be avoided by the power of distance learning you'll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. You wouldn't have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. Also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you.

However some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. Working in a group at times might not always be the best option. When reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever you're struggling with. Those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. If you're a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you.

Last but not least , Are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? You would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. In class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. When your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but you're not told what time your suppose to start at. If your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. In my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to.

To sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. If your school is offering this to you I highly recommend it. It can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you don't fall behind in class. You can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you.

I'm going to tell you two reason why I think it's not fair for students that only have a B average to play sports. My reasons are most kids have a C average and teachers won't be able to do anything in their spare time.

My example is most kids have a C average. My first supporting detail is you wont have any teams. You won't have any teams because if most kids make a C average then none of them would be able to try out.

My second supporting detail is no players. You won't have any players because they would all have made C' s and would not be allowed to try out.

My third supporting detail is you won't have any trophy's. You won't have any trophy's because if no one is allowed to try out then you won't win any games, and if you don't win any games then you won't get any trophy's to put in your display case, so none of the visitors will be able to see any because you won't have none.

My last example is teachers won't be able to do anything in their spare time.

My first supporting detail is no after school sessions. You wont have after school sessions for the teachers to occupy their time because you won't have any students on your team to stay after school. My second supporting detail is no pep rally's. You wont have any pep rally's because of no students on your teams, so the teachers won't be able to set them up in their spare time.

My last supporting detail is the teachers wont have anyone to help. They won't have anyone to help because no one would be on teams, and the teachers won't be able to help out with the students in their spare time.

In conclusion, I have told you two reasons why I think it's not fair to only have students to try out for sports based on their grades they make.

Community service is important for children to take part in I believe it should be a requirement for school. Helping out the community does take time away from what they need or want but in the real world you have to give time up for others. Community service is great way for kids at this school to grow. This task of helping will make them more giving and willing to help out , which is a great characteristic for a child to have. Simple tasks of service will help them be more responsible. They will have less time to finish what they need to, but it will have the children buckle down and be more efficient and responsible when it comes to time management. Community service also gets kids involved with their own community and have opportunities to help out and make the community a better place. By getting involved they are helping out the community and their self .Also it'll change the out look that many kids have about the community and they will have a better understanding of how a community functions and its problems. Community service does no harm it only helps the person participating in it . Simple services like cleaning up litter can make the community a much cleaner nice place to be in. That simple task will also teach the volunteer recycling methods and teach them how to treat things with respect. I believe community service should be a requirement it helps teach kids to be more responsible , giving, and caring. Children should have those qualities in their character and community service is a way they can explore the community and be a better person.

However, asking more than one person for advice may get you different answers because people have gone through different experiences. They most likely had different outcomes, some good and others bad. Asking multiple people for their opinions can improve your knowledge because people have gone through different experiences, the elderly has lived through history, and even if people aren't there your peers post blogs and websites online.

To begin with, everyone lives their own life and makes their own decisions; therefore, they go through different journeys and down different paths. When I was little, my mother told me a story her parents told her when she was my age. It started out with my grandma, Generic_Name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. She needed advice. My grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. Initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went well when she went through the same experience. Next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. Her next choice was to talk to her best friend, Generic_Name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet Generic_Name still gave her advice. Generic_Name was thankful she had asked three people because she received three different outcomes.

Additionally, an author once said, ""Treat your elders with respect as they are older and wiser."" The elderly has gone through going to school but while that happened and they were growing up they also lived through wars, poverty, some may have kids or even grandkids, and over the past about twenty or so years new ages/generations, and the upbringing of technology. The author mentioned ""wiser"", they have lived through so much and they were always learning something new. Therefore, they know a lot and can be another option for giving advice.

Lastly, whether the decision you have to make is life changing or a small choice there is always someone or something that can help. About two years ago my best friend, Generic_Name, called me and told me to come over as soon as I could. Not knowing what any of this was about, I rushed over there and she said she needed to talk. I listened while she told me this sad story about Generic_Name, her sixteen year old cousin, who was now pregnant. She continued to talk and asked me what I thought. I was speechless knowing that her cousin was thinking about getting an abortion. Generic_Name said that Generic_Name's parents and grandparents passed away in a car accident two months ago and Generic_Name was angry at the world so she went to a college party, had too much to drink, and met a guy. A month later, she found out she was pregnant and did not have anyone to talk to. She spent the next month looking up ""How to take care of a baby"", ""Abortion"", ""Teen Pregnancy"", and a lot of other things before she had talked to Generic_Name and asked for advice. Generic_Name had gotten some advice from blogs and websites online but she also wanted to talk to Generic_Name before she made a decision, but Generic_Name didn't know what to do, so she called me. The next week, we went to lunch with Generic_Name and had a long discussion. We didn't force her into or out of anything; although, we did give her our opinions. As we were leaving, Generic_Name mentioned that she was thankful that she looked up blogs and websites online and that she was able to talk to us. No matter how big or small the choice, someone is always there.

The advantages for limiting car usage is that it helps the envirornment to stay healthy because with so many countries with over populated cities have alot of cars which causes smog. Like in Vauban Germany they have gave up on there cars so they have baned cars, and that most of the population has got rid of their car, and or sold them to stay in Vauban which has a population of 5,500 residents. The people now in Vuaban walk of side walks, and are more actice most of the citizens like it that way. which that is a good way to get over car is to use bikes, skateboards, and ect. So that people can be more active, and social. It is also good that they do that so they can get a exercise than just sitting in a car, and driving to a location.

the advantages of limiting car usage is that it help prevents harmful chemicals and gases thar are bad for the air we breath because if we keep polluting the streets with cars those harmful and deadly chemicals, and gases go to the atmosphere and come back to us as air we breath, and those are not good things to put in your body. The cause of over populated cities like in paris, or bogota have cause alot of smog. So now what they have to lower the smog is that they have days when they dont drive cars, and that if you rode a car you would get fined. In Colombia Bogota they have time where that the people didnt mind not driving cars, and they would hike, bike or even take the bus.

7575,5030008,D9C99C58FDA5,train,"Nowadays, there is one sure thing we depend on to go from Point A to Point B: cars. Cars are used everywhere to drive to work, school, a park or wherever it may be. However, the total amount of automobiles moving out in the streets consumes up too much gas. This gas being released causes smog, or air pollution, that is harmful to our atmosphere & is one of the main causes of global warming. Next, the elimination of cars improves the safety of pedestrians and people wandering on the roads which has indeed prevented people from dying in countries like Colombia and France.

To begin with, when people are driving cars for whatever it may be, they are unintentionally harming the economy. This happens because cars run off of gasoline and when a car is accelerating, the gas is being burned by the motor engine which after is released into the air. Smog is produced being one of the top causes for global warming & this is an exceedingly problematic effect to the atmospherical being of humans and space. Moreover, Paris has reinforced a temporary driving ban due to these long-term, harmful effects to clear the air of the global city. If drivers refuse to obey, they would get fined 22 euros and up to 4,000 drivers were fined. They were blaming diesel fuel although, after five days of intensifying smog, congestion drastically dropped 60% competing against Beijing, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In addition, the elimination of cars in the streets has benefited society in a way that it keeps people safe. As various countries around the world face the risk of car accidents, innocent deaths, lack of resources, and car commuting, they beign to enact laws to try & stop these risky, dangerous downfalls from happening. In the suburbs located within Germany, residents of Vauban are pioneers doing what commuting executives have never done before: giving up their cars. This happens since street parking and driveways aren't allowed altough the streets are ""car-free"", a couple are found at the edge of a community as well as the tram running down Freiburg. Plus, without an abundant amount of automobiles anymore, cities become more loose and flow therefore providing a better walking path.

To conclude, cars on the streets may be efficient for people to get to places easily and rapidly, but the substances it releases is harmful to the environment. Smog and air pollution are formed when cars drive greatly contributing to global warming, because they consume up too much gas. Furthermore, not only does it cause air pollution, but it also creates a possibility of putting people's lives in danger by the factors that might affect the consciousness of a driver. So the eliminating of cars does the community good both physically and economically like it is practiced in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to explain to you why I think it would be a good idea to make only people with B averages be allowed to play sports or activities.

Many students in our school have a C average. Which means that a lot of people in the school could not play any sports or activities. I understand your reasons for why you would like students who have a B average to participate and I strongly agree.

First, in my opinion, if you cannot get your homework in on time, how could you also have extra time to play a sport, non the less an activity. Some parents tell there children ""school comes first.""

I do not believe that you can put your full effort into a sport or activity if you cannot even get your homework in on time. I understand some people may have been gone a day or week but they will be excused and have extra time to do that assignment.

Next, you might be the kind of person who might not study, well, with this new school policy, more students might be encouraged to do so, and take some time out of there spare time and study which will help them out in the long run. Plus, this makes the children want it more, so, they might try harder.

As you can tell, I think that the new school policy is a great idea. With this rule, it will hopefully make students to be more responsible and focused. In addition, it's not incredibly hard to even get a B average. I am an A average student and it's not the end of the world if you study before a test or turn in your homework.

145454,AAAXMP138200001518352125_OR_cleaned,DBE16C234CF3,train,"The twenty-first century is something different from past generations. Nowadays technology has made it easy to adapt and allowed for a more evolved teaching environment. Although technology is already put into use in most classrooms, a new debate has come forth involving schools allowing students to ""attend"" classes through online or video conferencing. Giving students the opportunity to participate in a class virtually is not beneficial because it will increase cheating, lower motivation and work ethic, and prevent students from forming social skills.

The generations in school right now are being taught in a way that has never done before. Every student with access to technology has an abundant amount of information at the edge of their fingertips. This has made students get lazy, and not worry about completing their work because all they have to do is simply type the title of their assigned work and answer sheets will show up. Cheating has been, and will continue to be a big problem in schools all over the country. New soft wares are being developed everyday with the sole purpose of helping students cheat. If a student is taking a class online in the comfort of their own home, they will access those soft wares and have a significantly lower chance of being caught since there is no teacher around. The fact that the class is based online means that students can easily find answers to a quiz or test given to them just by opening a new tab on their browser. There are different techniques used to prevent students from being able to access other browsers while on the virtual classroom but those students are still allowed access to their cellphone. In this generation kids, and teenagers especially are always connected. All of your friends and family are just a button away. If all schools included online school as an option for students, they would be able to use different types of technology not including their computers. If certain measures are taken so different browsers are not accessible during virtual classes, technology like apple watches, tablets, cellphones make it not only make it possible to use the internet, but also give students opportunities to socialize with their friends and share answers in that sense. Virtual classes will raise the amount of cheating done and affect the students negatively.

One problem in schools is that after the first semester, or even first quarter, students start experiencing academic burn-outs. Many students dread waking up each morning, but they find the motivation to wake up and attend school because it is on an implemented schedule. Being in a classroom environment helps students strive to be more like the others around them. Students at SCHOOL_NAME were given the option to enroll in semester based online class and more than half the students fell behind. The students progressively got more lazy and stopped finding the time to complete their online classwork. The lack of structure in online classes will negatively affect students since they are no longer forced to show up to class on time to complete their work. A new upcoming study shows that doing schoolwork where relaxation takes place, causes work ethic to decrease. Many students will do the virtual class from the comfort of their bed or couch. Simply being in that environment versus being at a desk and chair, will inevitably cause students to doze off and fall asleep. Distance learning will affect motivation and work ethic in students tremendously.

Humans are wired to be social, it is what they were born to do. Schools have created an environment where students can socialize and make bonds with the people in their communities. Social skills learned in school are vital to be successful in the future. If students were allowed to do their classes online, it takes away their ability to form those skills. The online classes would isolate the students and negatively impact the way they function in later stages of their life. Kids who are more social have less mental health issues. Being able to go to school and be surrounded with friends and people they know allows students to be happier overall. Staying home and doing your class from there would take that away from kids and the lack of socializing will cause an increase in loneliness. The aspect of personally going into school has shaped the way people will perform in the real world.

Although some may argue that online school is a better way of learning for them, it is clear that online school will not only cause short term problems, but also long term. If more students were enrolled in online classes performance rates will go down, cheating will be a bigger problem, and students mental health will be negatively impacted. It is time to stop allowing today's generation to rely on technology, and implement things that will prepare them for the real world.

13466,5030310,948596ED1AA0,train,"Many people believe that it is necessary to use a car to get from one place to another. Many studies have shown that this in fact is not true. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. I am in favor of limiting car usage because of the advantages it brings to the world. One reason to limit car usage is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. Another reason, is because many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. Lastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. Beneficial and critical, limiting car usage helps humans as well as the environment.

First of all, limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution worldwide. Reflective and didactic, Robert Fuller's ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" reflects the amount of pollution that is reduced due to limited car usage. For example, Robert Fuller explains that ""...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" This statement layers Robert's opinion that car usage can create vast amounts of pollution. If car usage is limited, the amount of particulate matter would decrease. For instance, this theory is created when Robert Fuller states ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

Another reason, is because many people around the world are in favor. Appauled and enthusiastic, Andrew Selsky's ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", molds the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages. For instance, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. The fact that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage is shown, when Andrew Selsky sates that ""Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic."" Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus is also in favor as he states ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" These statements show that limiting car usage is very beneficial and has many advantages.

Lastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is shown in Elisabeth Rosenthal's ""The End of Car Culture."" Elisabeth states that ""...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Elisabeth Rosenthal also states that ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants."" Limiting car usage also improves safety. Last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with telecommunications. Bill Ford wanted to partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This statement forms the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages. We as people of the world need to limit car usage for many reasons. The first reason is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. The second reason is that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. The last reason is, because limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is why we as citizens of the world need to limit car usage worldwide.    ",4,1621880000000.0,597,673,"

19561,AAAXMP138200000740732144_OR,CAD0AF209830,train,"Projects of any kind are often dreaded by most students, especially summer projects. Since some schools require these projects, the least they can do is make them student-designed. While there is less of a chance of the project being innapropriate or something easily put together last minute if it is teacher designed, it takes away so much of the students creative freedom. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows them to do their project on something they are passionate about, they are given more creative freedom, and their classmates can learn new things instead of everyone doing their project on the same topic.

With the load of school, extracurriculars, and homework students do not have nearly enough time to do things they are passionate about. Allowing students to pick their own summer project would give them the opportunity to learn more about something they love and get a grade on it. Additionally, if the project is about something that a student does not feel any sort of emotion towards, chances are, the student will not take as much time making it a great project because they do not care about the subject.

When a student completes a project outside of school it could be a variety of things. It could be a painting, a clay pot, or even a table. All of those things require the student to be creative and make it their own. School projects should somewhat resemble these projects. Students should at the very least be given a chance to use their own creative skills to make the project their own, instead of them being given a list of things to include in a powerpoint. If the students' were allowed to pick their own summer projects they would have so much creative freedom to really do the best they could on their project and make it something they are proud of.

Say there are around thirty kids in a class, and every kid has to present a project on the same topic. That is the same information rephrased thirty times, and that is over three class periods of sitting through essentially the same project thirty times. That is not something students would enjoy, and it is difficult to image that teachers enjoy sittting through all of those projects. Although, if every student in that class is allowed to pick their own topic that is thirty new topics that students in that class could learn about. Some of those topics might even peak other students' interests and they might try something new.

In summary, summer projects should be student-designed because they can do a project on something they are passionate about, they are given more creative freedom, and their classmates can learn something new.

Most people will sometimes ask others for advice, instead of just one person. In my opinion, asking for more advice from different people can be helpful, because it gives you more ideas/thoughts, you can learn more about the topic at hand, and it's helpful. Let's move onto my points.

Asking for multiple people for advice is a wise desision because you get more ideas or thoughts on the matter. Instead of just asking one person, you ask three or four, to see what they say. Sometimes, the person you ask doesn't give you the right response or answer. It's always a good choice to ask more than one person for their opinion or thoughts. Let's say you ask Generic_Name for help on the quiz review question. She thinks it's B, but you don't think that's the correct answer, so you ask Generic_Name. Generic_Name thinks the answer is C, which you think is the correct answer. See how asking more than one person for advice is beneficial? Asking for more than one person for advice is helpful because it gives you more ideas/thoughts. Onto my second point.

Asking multiple people for advice can be helpful because you can learn more about the topic at hand. You can learn more about dolphins if you ask more than one person. Let's say you ask Generic_Name what dolphins are. Generic_Name gives you some pretty basic information that you might've already knew. Then, you go ask Generic_Name, and he gives you more complex information about dolphins that you didn't know, that's super helpful. Don't be afraid to ask more people for help, because you can learn way more about the topic at hand.

Asking multiple people for help is beneficial in the way that it's just helpful. You'd be stupid NOT to ask multiple people. It's how people collect data from surveys, tests, and more. If you're just asking one person for help, you're not the smartest. You get more people's perspective's on something, which can help you alot. If one person says they don't like ice cream, but three people say they do like ice cream, it's pretty obvious what the majority thinks about ice cream. The point is, asking multiple people for help is beneficial because it's more helpful than just asking one person.

Well, that about wraps it up. I hope, from now on, you ask more than one person for help, or for anything. Asking multiple people for help is incredibly beneficial because you can get more ideas or thoughts, you can learn more about the task at hand, and it's just helpful.

27971,AAAXMP138200001630672144_OR,CFE773F1600B,train,"Summer projects, one of the most boring things to do during the summer break. Although they can be boring we have to accept the fact that they help with our education by not forgetting important key parts of our education such as the math we are taking. If we let the students make their own summer project it'll just become a disaster. Teachers should be in charge on what the summer project looks like and the structure of the project mostly because they know exactly what is needed of the student to do during the summer for them to be ready for the next year, students would design the the project as if it were the most easiest thing in the world, and although the kids can actually make it interesting and relevant to them they will also make it easier for the students to associate with other students for the answers of the project.

One of the major reasons that the teachers should design the projects for the summer is that they know what is expected for the year coming up and gets them ready for what's about to come. This may include some math problems that will help you remember things from the year that just ended so that way the students won't be all sorts of puzzled. In English class you can get kids to read a book so they don't forget their diction by making the students go in depth with their understanding of the book and the symbols presented in the book they are assigned. For example the summer before my 9th grade year when I was ready to begin the IB program at Generic_School. The teacher made us read a book of the few that they let us choose from and they made us go in depth with everything we have to read so that got me ready for the 9th grade year. Everything we did through out my 9th grade year was relatively simple since i already did for the summer.

Another major reason that teachers should be the ones designing the summer projects is because students, like most of us in the world, would make it easy because they will be wanting to try to have more time with lets say family, friends, play games, doing something that they love not stuck doing something that will not be any sort of fun except for the few that actually are super studious. From my experience as a high schooler there is multiple people cheat just because they want more time to spend to themselves, so if the students create the project themselves they would make it really easy because of the same reason I said earlier, they want to have more free time. For example when ever my teacher would make us pick whatever section of question we can answer my peers and I would pick the most easiest mostly because we know that we will have more times to goof off, its just a human thing most of us just find the easiest way out for things.

Although students may argue that they can actually make the project for interesting and more relevant for them. Yes, that is true, but what is the point of making a project interesting and relevant if i they dont seem to find the motivation to do it so they just end up cheating like some of the kids do. They can also argue that free time is really important, but if it wasn't for the teachers and the work they give we wouldn't know anything including them because they had teachers also so they know whats best for us. and yes free time is important but in reality youre wasting your time just goofing off and losing time that you could be working to be ready for the next school year and you wouldnt be able to forget the things you did during the past school year.

In conclusion teachers should be the ones to design the summer project because they know whats best for us for the school year coming up, the students would make everything super easy and they could cheat with a simple wink, and lastly students may argue that they can make it more relevant but in reality they are making the project less time consuming and they will have more free time. Summer projects is a topic that have really good opinions and facts for both sides on students and the teachers but teachers just want you to succeed and they push you to do so even if thats doing 50 problems for math or read a book and go in depth on what you have to read its just teachers want to see us become the next J.K.

I do not think that the use of technology to read our emotions would be valuable in a classroom. If they were used, the students may get mad, it could be a bother to the teacher, or it would be costly and takes regular upkeep.

If technology was used in classrooms, it would not be valuable. The students in the classrooms sometimes want to hide how they feel about someone or something, and having a machine track what they feel, could trigger them. A student can sometimes hide their anger about a student or assignment, but if this was applied, it would be obvious. Another reason they wouldn't be valuable is because if it reads the wrong emotion of someone, they person's anger or emotion may rise and become an even larger ordeal. Someone can already tell what is felt just by looking at someone's face for the most part, as the author stated in paragraph 5, so there is no point to have to have a machine do the same thing. A friend would be also able to see if you are faking a smile or hiding what you really feel. The teachers also are another reason they wouldn't hold any value.

A second reason that the machine is not worth it is because of the teachers responses. A teacher may now see how a student feels about something and this could lead to more disiplinary issues. The teacher may feel annoyed if the students become amused and there would not be a point to teaching. In paragraph six, it says, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" and this shows that they are becoming like a teacher and this could lead to a decrease in available jobs, kind of like what is happening with robots. The placement of these machines in classrooms could cause more stress on teachers and more to worry about on top of the student's needs. They aren't only a bad idea because of the teachers and students, but also the upkeep.

The final reason they should not be placed in classrooms is because of the price and upkeep. The machines would not be a cheap purchase and the schools have better items to buy for the school. The school my have to hire more people to make sure they are always working and this is also using more of the schools money. The device would be like any other piece of technology and would also require updates. The ""Da Vinci Code"" would not be totally accurate every time, and that could lead to a disruption. Nick D' Alto says, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" which shows how complicated the machine is and how easily it could misinterpret emotions.

In conclusion, the placement of technology in classrooms would hold no value. They would be a distraction to students, have negative effects on teachers, and entail a large cost and major upkeep.

119785,5030704,57B41EC7CB9A,train,"When ever a president gets elected in the United States of America, the votes that they recieve are from the electoral college process. The electoral college has 538 electors, each state in the United States of America has a certain amount of voters, one state might have more than others. For example, The state of California and Texas have the most votes throughout the whole country.

Some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end. For example, if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. And everyone's question might be ""who are those electors?' The electors can be anyone not holding public office. That's why there's a 60% vote against the electoral college.

The electoral college is widely looked at as a person, a non-democratic way of selecting a U.S president that is going to be overruled by saying the canidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. It is the electors that elect the presidents, not the people. But each party selects a slate of elector's trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral votes doesn't win the popular votes. This happened in 2000, when gore had more popular votes, but yet he had less electoral votes than George Bush.

I think the electoral college is a fantastic method of electing the United States of America's president, because for instance, let's say a person older than 18 who is allowed to vote and knows nothing about politics goes ahead and votes for the presidential canidate that has better hair, or maybe because he's taller, or he has a nice voice, then the next thing you know that the president knows absolutely nothing about the government or politics and votes a president based on their outside characteristics and not by the presidents knowledge or his intelligence or ability of helping the country out. And it's sad because at the end of the day the president that they chose can become so mean, rude,and clueless of what he/ she's doing. So then at the end we the people are stuck with bad leader for example, like Cuba, and north Korea and other harsh leader that are the president or maybe even  country regret having that disrespectful person that they chose just becasue of his characteristics on the outside instead of paying attention to the presidential canidates knowledge, and thats why we should still stick with the electoral college method.            ",3,1614870000000.0,1099,1450,"It is the electors that elect the presidents, not the people.

I feel as if, it was to be driverless no one would need to be included in the driver seat, unless the car is needed to be parked into a store parkinglot and if it was so driverless it still wouldn't need anyone to park the car into a parking lot. I feel as if Google, wanted better votes on the car they should out a little more effort into getting it to become more of a driverless car, without needing anyone to be in the driver seat or worrying about getting into any wreaks.

I would probably agree with the car if they knew who to blame a wreak on. Because, if your not incontrol of the car and just so happens the car starts to get out of control when you tried to turn the heat on but pressed the wrong button by accident. Is it the car owners fault or is it the manufactors fault for having another button by the heat and air conditioner? I feel as if the car would be safer if driverless cars had there a special road built for them, but the cost of that would be a over then a million dollars. i would agree with the driverless cars if thy had a road buildt just for the,m to drive on.

More reasons to why I don't agree with the driverless car is because, the car should be able to navigate it's self through roadwroks and they didn't really give much detail into the car and it not being able to fuction with the road work, baking out of drive ways and accidents. The article didn't explain much about the car it self, does the car take gas or will it be an electrical car.

I feel as if the car was to be electrical it would probably get more votes than what the car is getting now. I feel as if the car should be updated in many ways as in being able to drive no matter the condintion of the road. The article also didn't include if the car could drive through any type of weather. If the car was to slide on ice and crash into a pole whos fault it be the car owners fault or manfactors fault?

Positive things about the artical ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is that the cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Another thing is that in article it tells the reader about without the option of smarter roads, manufactors turned to smarter cars. I feel as both could of happened in a way and I feel that if we have smarter roads , manufactors wouldn't really have to worry about accidents happening or have to worry about the driver int eh car taking over in cause of a tight situation.

I feel the car would be a success because of the sensors the car has, i feel that with sensos on the car manufactors wuldn't have to worry about the car getting into wreaks, and i feel as if the car would be able to drive through raods that are being worked on.

I understand you are considering allowing us to bring our phones to school and letting us use them only during lunch periods and free times. There is no reason why we cannot do this. We are not disrupting class by using it during lunch or free times when we are not learning anything. It is understandable why we would not be allowed to use them in the class room because it would be disruptive to others and disrespectful to the teacher. We would also be willing to wither turn them off or put them on silent while we are in the library.

There are times when we may need to use our cell phones though. For example if someone has to call their mom or dad to tell them that they have an after school activity. How else would they be able to communicate with them. Another example would be if two students had to do a project together and had to start during lunch or study hall. If they did not have any classes together before then they could easily text each other in between class periods and find out a time that they could both work on the project.

I think if you allowed students to do that it might make them more willing to not use cell phones in the classroom. If they get to use them during breaks and free periods what would be the point of using them in class. Letting students use cell phones is a good idea for all of the reasons above.

I think I am going to agree with you on that because i feel that school should be first over sports. For these reason: one students maybe really good at the sport they play and maybe someday would like to become professional, but if they had bad grades no school is going to want to except them. A second reason is that they should be more interested in thinking about passing the grade they our in that playing sports. My last reason is their future, they will get no where in life having bad grades like that.

My first reason being the fact that students maybe really good at the sports they play, but once that sport is over and they have all failing grades and will have to suffer the consequences of doing all kinds of make up work to boost their grades up. Then they will become behind and everything will all be a mess.

My second reason being that they shouldn't worry about the sport they are playing, they should worry about the grade they are in and being able to move to the next grade and be able to play the sport again next year knowing that they passed.

My last reason being that if students are in high school they should start to worry about their future and if they will be able to go to a good college and get a good job to support their family's. Not almost be failing classes over sports that they may not even be the best at. Now if they are maybe try and convince them that if they are failing being good at that sport doesn't mean anything.

A big idea is that a face has been put on Mars from another life form. It? a rediculous thought with many people such as me shaking their heads at the crazy theroy. There is no way the another life form could put this face on Mars. It? just a cool natural landform that ironicly looks like a face.

Their are many different planets with many different natural landforms on them. Mars just happens to have one of the most interesting natrual landforms however. The face as people call it, is a huge rock formation that gives us an illusion of a face. Humans have claimed that Aliens have put this massive rock formation on there, but from a scientific side their is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that Aliens are real.

Yes, the face is quite mysterious, but their are plenty of queer landforms on every planet. The media is a place that has taken ¨The Face¨ and it has made it out to seem like Aliens have made it to scare us. I can understand why one who has no sceintific background might believe this, but these landforms can occur any where on any planet over a peroid of time.

Whether that advice is good or bad, it may be beneficial to you making a final decision. Most of the time, it is great to have multiple opinions on what decision you are about to make and if that is the best decision or not. It can prove crucial to making the best decision for you, and even others. By seeking multiple opinions from others before you make a decision, you can get more of an understanding about what other people think, get help by narrowing down options to choose from, and it can even open you up to even more good ideas.

Most people, when they have to make a decision, would want to know what other people would do in that instance. For example, a person could be shopping for clothes, and they might be stuck between two options to choose from. That person would want some help with trying to decide, so they would ask a few people about what they thought. By asking those people, the person would get feedback from the people that were asked, and that feedback would give the person a greater understanding about what others think. This can apply to any decision being made, not just when it comes to shopping. The advice that you receive just by asking other people helps you out a great deal when making a choice. This isn't the only benefit of seeking multiple opinions, though.

The next reason as to why seeking more than one opinion before making a choice is that by dong so, it will help you narrow down your options to choose from. You may have many different thoughts about what decision or choice you are going to make. There may be a lot of them, and you are going to have to narrow them down eventually. The best way to do that is to ask people for their advice. The people you ask will give you the advice that you need to make the best and smartest choice. Sometimes, some of the options you were thinking of may not have been brought up. It may have been because they were not as important as other options, or simply just because it would not be a good choice. Nonetheless, opinions from multiple people will help you eliminate unhelpful options or ones that are just of no use, which contributes to the greater idea on why seeking multiple opinions is beneficial to you making a decision.

The third and final benefit of seeking multiple opinions before making a decision or choice is that it may open you up to even more good ideas that you have not thought of or considered before. For instance, there could be something that you have to decide on, so you ask multiple people for advice. Those people might suggest an idea that is really good, and that idea could be better than one that you have previously thought of. This is why asking more than one person for advice can be extremely beneficial. The people you ask can come up with a great idea that will lead to you making the best choice that is possible, which is what you always want to do no matter what.

Overall, these 3 reasons provide a great overall conclusion that whenever you have to make a decision of any kind, you should always get some advice from multiple people. It proves to be very beneficial in the long run. By doing so, you can make the smartest and most logical choice. When you ask multiple people for their opinion, you will get a better understanding about what others think, get help by narrowing down options for you to choose from, and you may be introduced to more good ideas. These are 3 major benefits that come from getting multiple opinions before making a decision, and they tell exactly why you should do so.

As a young teen in America, I understand that using your phone while driving is very common nowadays. Although it is common, it's probably not the best decision to make. As technology improves, cell phone usage will continue to increase, especially in millennials. This does not mean that all cell phone usage is bad, but it does mean that everyone should reconsider using cell phones while driving. On a daily basis, I hear about people my age dying due to car accidents, because they chose to be on their cell phones while driving. Using your phone while driving can cause distractions, accidents, or put passengers and other drivers in danger.

While studying for my driver's test, I was overwhelmed by the seriousness of the laws about phone usage and driving. Phone usage while driving is against the law for several reasons. One reason why cell phone usage is against the law is because of the distractions that it can cause. We commonly see people using cellphones while driving every day, but it is illegal, Found on GHSA.org . Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions such as texting, or using social media. I strongly feel individuals should solely focus on driving when their car is in motion. When I started driving, I understood the importance of waiting to respond to any notifications that I receive, and putting my phone on do not disturb. I think that everyone should consider using this feature on their cell phones because it can potentially save their life or someone else's.

Furthermore, I think that driving while using your phone is not only dangerous, but it's also could be the reason for half of America's fatalities. It only takes seconds for someone to look down at their phone and cause a wreck. Cell phone usage itself is expanding, but I think that if people aren't considerate of their lives they should be considerate of others. For example, phone usage while driving could include snap chatting, taking selfies, searching for a song, or as simple as using your phone for directions. Phenomenally, phone usage has turned into a habit.

I've seen people use their phones while driving and it makes me question if they even care about their own lives. I think that risking someone else's life to check social media, respond to a message, or simply changing a song is ignorant. In today's society, phone usage has become a serious problem and I want to stress to millennials and my fellow peers, it can wait. Seeing people using their phones while driving not only bothers me, but it concerns me about the well being of my family. Phone usage while driving can cause car accidents, which can lead to a lifelong lesson. Whether the car accident results in a bad injury or death, it can change your life, forever.

Subsequently, as a teenager, I commonly see my friends posting videos while driving down the road with my other friends. Cell phone usage and driving are very illegal but most get away with it because they do it discreetly. I think that in today's time, everyone struggles with the concept of not ""texting and driving"". As mentioned before , my peers texting or making snapchat videos while driving, could cost them their lives. Mentioned on Healinglaw. com, there are stories teeneagers getting into wrecks because of the distractions of phone usage and their passengers distracting them. This careless act resulted in a bad wreck, which caused serious injuries. I often think to myself, ""why would one want to put someone else's life at risk, over a text?"" Something that I realized was that I cannot control my friend's actions, but I can control my own. I love my life enough to not risk it over a text message.

In conclusion, I think that even though phone usage while driving can be very tempting, it is not necessary. I think that phone usage while driving should continue to be illegal, I do not agree with putting someone's life at risk over a simple text or video. Putting your own life in danger or someone else's life in danger is a careless act that must be shunned upon. I also don't agree with the simple distractions that come along with phone usage and driving. Once one is behind the wheel, their phone should be on the do not disturb mode, and they should put their phones face down until they reach their destination. If a person has to use their GPS system while driving, it should be properly mounted in their car in concordance with all of the existing cell phone usage while driving laws. With that being said, I understand the concept of using a GPS while driving. However, I disagree with the concept of cell phone usage to text others and the use of social media platforms while driving. It can wait.

When people vote they are voting for presidents not the electoral college its not right to have a electoral college. Because it should be the peoples choice.

(In source 2) Even presidents want to get rid of the electoral college that is saying something. People would rather have a direct election then the kind we have now and I agree. See when the people are voting for electors they dont know what that elector is going to vote for they can only hope for what he is going to vote for. (source 2) Paragraph 13 ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" I agree with this source it is what my opinion is, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. i think that the electoral college should be abolished. Who knows maybe some of the presidents woukd have been different because the electoral college could have changed some peoples votes. Say some wanted Obama not to be president but the state elector picked him that could be a game changer. It is suppose to be a democracy the people make the choices this is not a dictatorship.

What if the state all voted for one president then the electoral college voted for the other that would throw off everything. There would probably be riots to be honest. This is making our country sound like a dictatorship. We the people of the United States of America deserve to pick our leaders.

I dont see why we cant have this vote as a country then there wouldnt be a topic to argue about. The electoral college is a decision that was not in the constitution i believe so it can be removed very easily. My opinion is that we take the electoral college out because it is causing nothing but arguing. We deserve to pick if we want to have a president we want or not.

157986,AAAXMP138200000821282810_OR,E68CDA395B2D,train,"Often times, when we're looking for advice we talk to multiple people, why is that? When your looking for advice or a solution to a problem, do you talk to more than one person? If so, did that lead to a better result? In my experience talking to multiple people about a problem proved to be a good idea. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of people's experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.

First off, one reason why you should seek multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice are people's experiences. People's experiences shape who they are, and determine how they respond to certain situations. Different people have different experiences, leading to different responses. Someone who has ran into your situation before will most likely give better advice than someone who's never been in that situation. People tell you to respect your elders because of all the experiences they've had, older people probably have a lot of solutions to problems you may have.

Secondly, another reason why you should talk to multiple people about a situation are perspectives. Every person has an unique perspective, influenced by their past experiences or current situation. For example, if two people went to the store, a three year old and a twenty one year old, their perspectives would be very different. Everybody looks at a situation from a different perspective, and that can prove useful when you're looking for advice. The way someone comprehends a situation can be heavily influenced by their perspective.

Lastly, there are people's backgrounds. Someone's background is made up of many different things including ethnicity, religion, or culture. Across cultures situations can be interpreted and handled differently, so someone's background can impact their interpretations of situations or problems. All this can lead to advice you wouldn't get from your own background. Someone's background plays a role in the first to things I mentioned, experience and perspective. People's unique backgrounds can give them unique experiences and perspectives, that might differ from your own.

In conclusion, there are many benefits to seeking multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice, and there are many things that can have an impact on the advice people may give you. If you didn't ask others for advice, you would only have your own knowledge to deal with your problems, instead of the world of knowledge at your disposal.

Plenty of people don't understand how helpful it is too talk to someone else or get advice from others. some people could be going through the same things you are or have experienced the same problems as you. If they have moved on from it and learned from it than they should be able to help you do the same. Seeking help or advice from others isn't and never will be a bad thing. Sometimes you just can't do it on your own even though you say you can. I'm almost positive that most people have experienced one or two problems they needed help with.

Getting multiple opinions from different people is a great option. It gives you more options to work with in the long run. When it comes down to it you might need those other options because the one you have tried just didn't work out how you planned. when I was younger I used too deal with serious family problems, I would always go to my grandma for advice. She always knew what to say and what would help cheer me up, but there were sometimes when her advice just wasn't what I was looking for. So I would go talk to other family members including my grandpa, brother, and aunt, but I didn't just talk to family members about my problems. I realized that I needed a counselor, so I went and got one and surprisingly they helped a lot more than I expected.

I know a lot of people out there don't like to seek advice from anyone because they are scared that nobody will listen to them or that someone will make fun of them. I understand all of that but, seeking attention with someone you know is gonna help like your mom or your grandmother, or just any family member in general would still be a good idea or at least one you should think about. because you never know people could be there to help you and want you to be happy, not bring you down and see you sad. seeking multiple opinions from different people gives you more room to think on the decisions you wanna make and help you make better choices. When having multiple opinions it really gives you the chance to think about the choice you wanna make but also make sure you are picking the right one.

All the decisions you make reflect back on you. So that's why having multiple opinions is good. You can really get into detail and think about each opinion really carefully to ensure yourself that the advice your are choosing to use is gonna help you be a better person, make your life easier, and hopefully help you make the best choices you can possibly make.",4,1617810000000.0,711,1403,"It gives you more options to work with in the long run.

But, if you let the students choose what the project should be about, then they will want to complete it a little bit more than when a teacher designs it. In this paper I will be explaining why students should design their own projects instead of teachers. Students should design their own projects because they will be more excited and eager to work on it, the projects would be better because the students would most likely spend more time on it, and lastly the students would get to enjoy more of their summer because they would get the project done and not feel like they worked super hard.

If the students were to design their own project they would be more eager to work on it. This is because the people that make the topic usually have some interest in the topic. And with interest in the topic the students would want to work and actually spend time on the project. When a teacher makes a project it is almost always less appealing than a student made project. Causing the students to not want to work on it and learn. this is why a student made project would cause the students to be eager and ready to learn more about the topic.

Furthermore, the projects would be better because the students actually care about them. See when a teacher makes the project, A student like myself would just rush to get it done and get a good passing grade then enjoy my summer. but if students made it, I would most likely spend a little more time on it causing the project to be more complete and more presentable. In return students would get a decent grade, be more informed about the topic, and get to feel better about themselves in the end.

Lastly, students would get to enjoy more of their summer. It would feel like this anyway because the student made project wouldnt really feel like a project. especially if it is a group project, it would just be like hanging with your friends in the summertime. and If you are a really eager student, you could get the project done in the first week or two of the summer then get to spend the rest of your time doing whatever you like to do during the summer.

In conclusion, A student made project would be the best option for the students. Because the would get to enjoy their summer and learn a little at the same time. and in all they wouldnt feel obligated to such a chore during the summer.

Electoral collage  as the office of Federal Register in quote ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting og the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President"".  It's a bad idea to me when you can just make everyone vote for who they want not who just a couple hundred people want.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors which a certain amount need to vote as 270 is the precise number is required.  Each candidate running each has a group of electors, they are originally chosen by the candidates politicial party.  The choice where the people choose and vote is way easier than that, we have a choice for what we want.

So picture you're at home, burdened with homework, rushing to get it all done and all of a sudden, your parent gets an email from the school saying that every student will have to take one extracurricular activity. Your parents are worried because extracurricular activities are expensive, how you'll get to and from that activity, and your school work. How fair is that? It puts stress on you and your family. Don't get me wrong, extracurricular activities are great for growing teenagers, it can be a great safe space for them, but why should they be forced to take one?

They Are Really Expensive

Some popular activities are dance, martial arts, sports, and music. Which are all VERY expensive. They are great extracurricular activities to do, but so expensive, and not all parents can afford them. For dance, costumes are at least $100, dance shoes vary on quality, but are usually expensive, dance wear is about $30-$50 per piece, and makeup, lots and lots of makeup. Plus, you usually have to know how to sew, and if you don't already, you might have to add the expense of sewing classes in there. See how they all add up? That's about $230 for just costumes, dance wear and shoes. Let's say your parent is a teacher, the average teacher makes $65,000 per year which isn't that much. Some even make $35,000 per year, even less. And to have school expenses, plus that, that's a huge chunk of your parent's paycheck. Some parents have to use that money to pay rent or mortgage, heating bills, water bills, electricity bills, and extra things like clothes, and food. That doesn't give them that much of a flexible amount to spend. Some kids prefer to save their parent's money, plus if they dont want to take one, that's even more unfair.

They Won't Be Committed To It

Let's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do. How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it.

They May Have Other Things To Do

So as we all know, in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. That's 5:30. Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!). They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework. That makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day. It could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity.

So how much is forcing students to do an extracurricular activity really saving them? I feel like if schools force students to do an extracurricular activity, they will see lower test grades, lower participation rates, much more attitudes towards them, and more tardiness. This behavioral change will be because of the time wasted on things they don't want to do, and less sleeping hours. Though extracurricular activities are great for them, dont force them on people, because instead of helping, it's actually hurting. ",5,1615940000000.0,3636,3722,"

Our School has changed a lot over the years, now we have better technology and different projects that we do in class. Yet my main concern to you is Cell Phones. I strongly agree that Policy 1 is most certainly the best choice; Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The reasons why is simply because if you tell them otherwise to not bring them at all, they still will. Also parents will complain if there child does not have there cell phone with them at all times. Yet if you allow the students to have their cell phones with them but turned off during class is the perfect policy. Then as the Policy states they can have them during their own time, like during lunch and breaks.

You may be thinking that this is not a good idea, but it really is a very great policy. Even though cell phones are a major distraction when it comes to education. It is a force of habit that if you own a cell phone you will most likely always have it in your pocket or your bag. I do recommend that if a student is caught with a cell phone that they take it away from the student and give it back to the owner at the end of the day. But if you band having cell phones like in policy 2 the student body will get very offended and not even obey that policy.

Another reason why i say Policy 1 is the way to go is because if any emergency's where to happen the child would have their phone to get notified by. Even though the School does this with their own phone system it is still important because, if a problem came up with one of their Aunts or other close family members the School Board would have no clue.

As well as if a child needs to say after they have a fast way to notify their parents or gardenias. Or if they needed to take a bus home or go with another parent or friend to reach home after school they would have a fast way to notify their parents or gardenias, and lastly if they got locked out of their house after coming home from School they would have a cell phone with them to notify their parents or gardenias. So i strongly agree that Policy 1 is the one you should choose, so i hope that you do!

I think we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school because they will be turned off in school periods, we should be able to use them during lunch periods and free time, and also during important events.

My first reason why we should be able to bring our cell phones to school because they will be turned off. They won't be a big distraction in class. Teachers wouldn't be able to tell if we had our cell phones or not because they would be turned off during class periods. either they would be turned off or on vibrate. So the teacher wouldn't notice if we did have our cell phones or not.

My second reason why we should have bring our cell phones to school is because when we do have lunch or free time at school we should be able to use them then but when lunch time and free periods are over we are going to put them up immediately. But while we are at lunch we should have time to text friends or catch up with others or the ones that weren't at school that day tell them what they missed or what they had to make up that day or the day they come back. We should also have our phones at school because what if we have an emergency and we have to call home to our parents and tell them.

Finally, my third reason why we should be able to bring our phones to school is because when we do have important events. Our cell phones would be turned off and wouldn't be a big mess up when it does go off they wouldn't have to stop and tell us to turn the phone off and tell us to leave cause the phone would already be turned off and wouldn't be a big mess up.

In my conclusion, these are my reasons why would should bring our phones to school because they would be off in class periods, we should be able to bring them during lunch periods and free time, and they would be turned off in important events. I mean children would bring their phones anyway if they wanted to or not. They think it's their phone they can bring it so the principal should let us bring them to school no matter if they are on or off.

As we progress into an advanced, modernized, and technological world, the need for attending schools and jobs becomes questionable. New technology has allowed for the ability to work from home through online resources. Due to these advancements, the advantage of students being able to attend schools from their houses has risen. Some schools have considered this topic and are offering distance learning as an option for students. Though some parents acquire concerns about the health of their kids being glued to their homes, distance learning should be acceptable if not taken for granted. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it advances their time-management skills, allows for the development of hobbies, and provides time for students to build relationships with their families and friends.

Distance schooling benefits students by teaching them time-management skills. By having students set aside specific time for video conferencing or online courses, they will be able to acquire skills on time-management. For example, over the course of one semester, my sister attended college through online courses and exclaimed, ""If there is one thing I loved and learned from the idea of having online classes, is time-management. I would plan my day out from start to finish and execute all tasks and assignments in one day"" (Generic_Name). As proven by her exclaim, distance schooling offers students a chance to plan out their day and be able to set appointments at specific times to perform their school-related tasks. This is beneficial to the student because they have the opportunity to control their day-to-day lives. Through time-management as well, students will develop traits such as responsibility and independence, which is the goal for the future generation.

Alongside the strong character traits acquired by students through distance learning, students are allowed the opportunity to expand and develop hobbies. For example, my friend, who is home-schooled, commented, ""I have much more time on my hands that in one day, I go practice boxing, learn to play the ukulele, volunteer at the senior citizens home, spend time with friends, and study"" (Generic_Name). Because of their time-management skills, students are able to set aside time to perform other tasks and hobbies during the day. As proven by my friend's comment, students are able to execute different kinds of tasks in just one day without having a time-restriction due to school hours. If students were to personally keep attending schools, about eight hours from their day is lost due to the fact that there are only so many hours in a day. Due to distance learning, students are given the opportunity to expand in certain aspects and hobbies in their lives such as art, cooking, sports, etc... and they may also discover new talents or obtain jobs - allows for self-discovery. This also teaches students what the assistant principal at my school always reminds his students, and that is, ""There is more to life than academics"" (Generic_Name). Distance learning offers various benefits in students' lives such as the possibility to develop hobbies.

In addition to the advantages of distance schooling, students are provided additional time to spend with their loved ones. Because of distance learning, students obtain extra time in their hands which can be used to spend with their friends and families. It is known that after high school, most students leave their homes and join the journey of independence. This proves that these young adolescents only have so much time to spend with their loved ones before starting a new chapter of their lives, independently. My dear mother always reminds me, ""These years are the years of your life, so live your lives and live it with the people around you"" (Generic_Name). Distance learning will provide students the gift of spending time with their families. It is very crucial and beneficial for students, and people, in general, to build relationships with their family because they will always be blood and one's safety net. Distance learning could possibly teach students the value of life, friendship, and family.

In conclusion, distance learning offers numerous benefits to students that will only teach them the meaning of life and its means of survival through independence, time-management, self-discovery, and strengthened relationships. It leaves students with skills acquired which schools may not be able to accomplish. Distance learning is the guide for the world's future generation of successful leaders.",5,1621870000000.0,1831,1984,"Alongside the strong character traits acquired by students through distance learning, students are allowed the opportunity to expand and develop hobbies.

Also the next problem that I am going to be talking about is a pass for the drivers crime on a crash. The next thing I am going to talk about is the finacial rate. These are the most troubling thing that are running around in my mind.

The first of the many problems is the road problems that can hurt any one on the road. If there is a sewer problem in the middle of the street that the city workers are working on the driverless cars won't have a way to detect the workers. Yes they might install a camera or a sensor to indicate that and alert the driver, but it can alert him to late and the result on that is there is already a crash. Also the car can't tell whether their is a red light or a green light it can only go to the direction it was programed to go to. There can be many more problems that anyone else can say that I'm not saying and think to your self's ""why do they need to alert you before the car doesn't know how to drive a certain way"".

The second reason for the negative aspect of the driverless cars is the passes on a crash. I think that if a person is going to court for getting in a crash because of his driverless car. I am not saying that he should get punished for buying that car, but they should understand that that they should be watching the road. And if someone says that the were sleeping while the car was driving they should go to jail for it. Their might be a worst punishment for it, but they should already know the bad side of the driverless car is not a game.

The last reason i am going to talk about is the finacial rate. Well I should call it money problems for everyone, but I wanted to sound smart. The company will have to sell them expensive prices because of the hardware, software, and other technology that is being combined with the car is not cheap. The people that would want to buy or rent it would have to do alot of work just to buy the car. Buy alot of work I mean he has to win the lottery and still work to still make payments on the car.

There is alot more reasons but i leave it up to the different people that are going to write about it. I hope to the people that read this that there is a positive and a negative side to everything.

90019,2171003439,11D36CD1AC96,train,"Dear Mrs. Principal, I strongly believe that you should not put the policy of students needing to have at least a B average in order to play sports. I feel this way for a couple of different reasons. First of all, students that don't have good grades need to be able to play sports in order to keep them in school, and secondly many kids that have learning disabilities such as ADHD play sports, but can't keep their grades up.

Playing sports in school entices kids to go to school for the chance to play on the team. Many kids only go to school because they can play sports, and they know that if they stay in school and are good enough at their sport, they might get a chance to play at the collegiate level, and maybe even the professional level. Those kinds of kids don't really care too much about their grade, and playing sports makes school bearable for those kids. If they had to maintain a B average, most kids would drop out of school at the first chance they got, not try harder.

Secondly, some kids with learning disabilities love to play sports, even if they can't get good grades. Kids with ADHD or dyslexia could be very talented or just love to play sports, but wouldn't be able to if they had to keep their grades at a B. You would be robbing those kids of an opportunity to win the school respect, and an opportunity to make friends along the way.

Sure some kids would work harder in order to play, but I can almost guarantee that the majority of them wouldn't. It is much fairer the way it is now, where if you have two D's or one F, then you can't play until you bring your grades up, but it is simply unfair to expect all kids that want to play sports to maintain a B average,

Why? Most of the students in the 20% said: ""It's free, it helps you do better, and you know people more."". In my opinion forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities even though it sounds cruel, is actually really helpful! My three reasons as to why are, students can make new friends and recognize teachers whom they've never known before, it can allow them to try harder in school and reach for a higher goal, and in many cases it can help them be able to find out new things and explore something else!

Forcing students to participate in extra curricular activities, helps students make more friends and know more teachers. I say this because say in sports you have to have a team right, and together you win, travel, and do other things. Also you have to plan, so there includes talking and you get to know everyone there. Having new friends would probably mean that you can be able to reach for another goal.

Doing extracurricular activities can help you want to do better in school because you have a new occupation and maybe you like the new activity you're doing but it requires you to have good grades. So you'll want to have good grades in order to continue doing that activity you like.

Extracurricular activities can help them find out what they like and what they dont like or they re not specifically good at. This way they know what does not challenge them and what is a challenge for them. Sports is a good example because of running, jumping and putting yourself at the limit. Some people can run, some people can't run. Some people can jump some people can't jump.

Being forced to do activities is not fun. But not all the times is everything bad. Some people might enjoy activities, some might not.

What Is the Electoral College?

in the 2000 election the president that won popular vote (Al Gore) lost the election because the Electoral College had the majoraty voting for George W. Bush. The Electoral College takes away the individuals voice.

The College does however provide a reliable service. For instance if there were to be a tie in popular votes, the College's vote would balace it.

Students attend school 5 days a week for about 8 to 9 months each year. There are many ways you can attend school. There is public school, private school, and online school that you can attend at home. I think the most beneficial way to attend school is public school. I think public school is the most beneficial way because, the students that is attending can physically get out of the house and socialize with his or her peers. Also in the United States public school is completely free! I think the least beneficial way to attend school is online school. I do not think it is beneficial for students to attend school online from home because, there are too many distractions at home, the cost of online schools compared to other schools, and it makes it easier for students to cheat.

One reason why i do not think online school is not beneficial is because of the distractions that can be found at home. When a student is physically attending school they tend to be more motivated then students who attend school online at home. This is because the student that is attending the school is aware that it is a school environment and that everyone is there to get the education they need. However, when a student attends online school they are more likely to get distracted. This is because students that attend online school are in a home setting that contains many distractions such as, easy access to electronics, food, and any other forms of entertainment. Online school will also motivate students to get up and do other things instead of doing the work they were assigned and supposed to do. This will cause the student to turn in the assignment late or even not turning the assignment in at all (which can eventually lead to bad grades).

Another reason why I think online school is not beneficial is because of the price. Online school is way more expensive then any other schools. Parents of students that attend online school have to pay thousands and thousand of dollars every month in order for their child to continue on attending school online. Public school on the other hand is completely free and anyone can attend it. In my opinion, if online school had a higher education rate I would understand why it is so expensive, but the thing that is really interesting to me is that online school is receiving similar education with the people that don't attend school online.

Finally the last reason why I think attending online school is not beneficial is because it makes it easier for students to cheat. I think it is easier for a student to cheat while attending online school is because there is no one watching them when they're working on an important assignment like a test or quiz. When no one is watching them the student might get the urge to cheat. A few examples of cheating maybe, searching up the answer to a question online or even ask someone else to do the assignment for them. The reason why students attending online school would cheat is because they know that it is harder for them to get caught. In public school there is always a teacher in the room while the students are taking a quiz or a test. Because there is a teacher in the room the chances of a student cheating on an assignment decreases.

This is because when a teacher is present in the room the student is possibly afraid of getting caught. If a student is ever caught cheating there will always be a consequence.

School is a very important aspect of someones future and life. So in conclusion, I think taking online school at home is not beneficial because, the distractions found at home, the cost of online schools compared to other schools, and it makes it easier for students to cheat. Yes online school still might be a school where people attend to learn, but I personally think the type of school a student is attending matters because it effects their ability to learn and comprehend things. ",5,1621550000000.0,3518,4005,"School is a very important aspect of someones future and life.

118205,5022777,6C3D375416FE,train,"Dear Senator...

The electoral college has recently been a very controversial topic in the world of politics. Many believe that it's a significant system, that's why the Founding Fathers created it, while others argue that it doesn't necessarily work as well. The Electoral College is a process in which there is an agreement between the president's election by a vote in Congress and the president's  election by a popular vote made by the citizens. There should be a change in the system into changing election by a popular vote since the Electoral College is not only an outdated system, but it gives the citizens no control over who Congress will be picking.

To start off, the process of the Electoral College should be changed since it's an outdated system. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" it says ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachroism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" Even the article that seems to be favoring the electoral college introduced it as so. It can be seen that it is a process that has been around since America itself, but America has constantly been changing and innovating and it needs a more flexible system to cast the votes. In ""What is the Electoral College""? it states that ""THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS QA COMPROMISE"" HENCE THIS IS STATING THAT THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED A LONG TIME AGO AND IT NEEDS SOME CHANGES.

TO CONTINUE, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED SINCE IT DOESN'T GIVE THE CITIZENS ALOT OF CONTROL AS TO WHO THE CONGRESS WILL BE PICKING. IN ""THE INDEFENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, IT SAYS THAT 'THE SINGLE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE DISASTER FACTOR."" WHAT THIS IS, IS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE NO CONTROL WHOM THE ELECTORS VOTE FOR. AS WELL, IN THE SAME ARTICLE, IT STATES THAT ""AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS UNFAIR TO VOTERS. BECAUSE OF THE WINNER TAKE ALL SYSTEM IN EACH STATE, CANDIDATES DON'T SPEND TIME IN STATES THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NO CHNACE OF WINNING.'' WHAT ALL THIS SAYS IS THAT, THE VOTERS HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS PICKING, AND IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO ANOTHER SYSTEM.

TO CONCLUDE, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED TO A NEW SYSETM WHICH IS FAIR AND MORE TRUSTFUL TO THE VOTERS. NOT ONLY IS THE SYSTEM OUTDADE, BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE VOTERS ALOT OF CONTROL. A NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE INTRODUCED. ALTHOUGH MANY AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE CHANGED, ALSO SOME BELIEVE IT SHOULD STAY HOW IT IS.

I don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity, because whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done,and most of the students already do an out of school activity,and students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do.

So what, they didn't participate in an extracurricular activity, that shouldn't be a barrier for them to graduate. Just because they didn't take part in the chess club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity.

What if you dont have time? Most students already do an after school activity like sports, or a youth group. Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one. If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity. So students who already do after school activities dont really have time for an extracurricular activity.

What if you just don't want to? Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do.

Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity.

Our world today mostly depends on computers and machines to do most of everything. Many inventors and scientist have discovered so many technological things and as the years progress, we get smarter and smarter and come up with more discoveries. Since we depend so much on technology, its a norm to use it, so mostly everything scientist, inventors and doctors come up with is valuable or useful.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of this new technology the Facial Action Coding System, has worked with many other scientist and doctors to create this technology, that enables computers to identify human emotions. This is a very valuable technology that our world needs today. There are plus and down sides to this argument of the technology being valuable or not. It is valuable because it can be use for many things throughout the world, for example paragraph 6 states, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This technology would help the teacher see what he or she needs to do to be able to make the class more exciting to make students learn and pay attention more. Paragraph 8 states, "" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" The technology would be valuable in a situation like an important election, where if a person running for something is lying about something, you would be able to tell using the help of the FACS.

In conclusion there are many reasons why we should or should not use the Facial Acting Coding System. We depend on technology most of the time, so this would be just another cool addition to our collection of discoveries we already have. Knowing the exact emotion of your mom, dad or friend from a computer software, would be very useful to see if there telling the truth or not.

This is wrong and cause many problems. I disagree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments.

The first point is that students may not have time for these activities. For instance, students could be participating in other events that are not provided by the school. If students tried to participate in both activities, one could get in the way of another and cause issues. Students may also miss the activities because they are spending time with their families. If they were forced to go to these activities, they could loose the time they would be spending with their family by participating in the activities. Another problem that could occur is the parents not having the time to take their children their activities. This could be cause by work or any other event that the parents must attend.

The next point is that students may not be interested in the activities that their school provides. This could be because the school may not have many activities. If the school does not have many activities, some students will be left out and forced to choose one that they do not want to participate in. Another reason could be that the school does not have the money for specific activities. For example, a student may want to participate in wrestling, but the school cannot provide the needed gear and mats. This would mean that the student cannot participate in an activity that they would like to participate in.

The final point is that students may not be able to complete assignments. If a student has a very important test that they must take, they have to study for it. If the student cannot study for tests, they may get a poor grade. Students may also have projects or homework that must be completed. If they do not complete these things, the student's grade could fall and they would have to work harder to raise it. If they still did not have the time to work extra because of the required activity, they could suffer from an even poorer grade.

In conclusion, students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments.

Breathing is something every living thing has to do to survive. At that another question. Have you ever made the connection between driving and breathing? Pollution is the connection, in europe twelve percent of the green house gases are from the muffler.

In the extreamest of places like Beijin there is so much exhaust in the air that you can see it. They call this smog, smog is very dangerous, breathing large amounts could easily lead to lung cancer. People all around the world are looking for the solution to this horrible problem. Hybrid cars some say, others solve the problem and live in car free comunities.

There are great advantages to car free comunities. The main dis advantage being that if you have to travel far you would have to use public transportation. The main advantages are that there is no car exhaust in the air. Also there is no road rage or traffic jams to worry about. Car-less comunities are spreading and one day we might factor out car exhaust as pollution and as a problem.

In major cities like paris they couldn't ban all driving so they compromised and made limitations on driving and giving small fines to non cooaperating drivers. congestion went down sixty percent in Paris in five days of limited driving. If we all just try and limit our driving a little we could help everyone breath a little better. If we control it now we could get rid of the issue before we are fined like the four thousand in France that week.

111683,5165367,ECBACB8EABB8,train,"Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States and I know I'm not alone on this one. ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their life time agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electorial college!"" That's not enough well, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" 60 percent is more than a half, now it says over 60 percent which would be past 60 percent. Remember the disaster factor , it is unfair to voters, and what if there is a tie in the electoral vote.

First of all, lets just take it into thought that it is unfair to voters. How? Well, ""Beacuse of the system winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" state."" In 2000, the campaign that was going on, well 17 states did not see the candidates at all. Also, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. What about the fact that, ""Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Not even one. Some might say that it doesn't matter if they have a campaign ad or not, believe me, I've heard it before. Having a campiagn ad shows people what you want to do, how you want to help, how you want to make a change, ect... I don't understand how unfair it can be to people.

Second of all, what would happen if there was a tie in the electoral vote? Well then, the election would be passed to the House Of Representatives, state delegation vote on the president. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35 million voters."" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

Third of all, lets just go back to memory lane and revisit the

Disaster Factor . This was the single best argument against the electoral college. ""The Americans people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century;the system allows for much worse."" State legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors. ""In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...."" Want that to happen again now?

Thank you for reading and understanding my point. You have an opinion and I respect that, but I also have one too. Sometimes they just need to be heard. So lets just say that it s unfair to voters, there could be a tie, and lets not forget the Disaster Factor. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Have a good day.

It would also keep the driver protected and also other drivers on the road protected. And also the sensors on the car modify when you are to close to a object or are going to hit a object before it is going to happen. And also the dubbed LIDAR use laser beams to form a constant updateing 3-D model of the car's surroundings with this combination the input is necessary for the driverless to mimic the real skill of a human at the wheel. And with the assistance and help of google the GPS his able to connect to google maps to navigate the driverless car to it's destination. With the sensors on and in the car drivers assistance isnt a problem, with the antilock brakes the is willing to stop when something is blocking it or is comeing at it with a equal speed. With more roadside assistance from google you can connect your cell phone to the car and answer the phone as you please and still be able to safely drive on the road.

With some of the assistance there is another added one its called ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but the special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of wheel. But not any of the cars made today so far has not accomplished makeing cars competely driverless they can break themselves, steer and also accelerate and all this tecnology keeps driver notified when on the road.

The car cant do all this on its on it needs human skill and assistance at the wheel along with it. Such as steering and working its way through work zones and getting its way around accidents. But the human at the wheel must be paying attiention and alert to whats ahead of him or her. And when a situation occurs it must require human assistance.

The human does not have complete control on stopping the vehacle. GM has a special development , when ever the vehicle is in danger or is backing up into a object the seat vibrates. and when the vehicle cant manage somthing the human can it announces the human should take over and it sends other ways and signals the driver another way if not seen that way. there is also another way to keep the driver focused on the road and to make sure there are cameras watching the driver to make sure the drivers remain focuesed on the road, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.

automakers and manufactuers have devolped a new and fun way to make driver pay attiention to the road and to keep the driver safe they will continue makeing these changes to the automoblies today and in many more years to come. they have predicted that in 2020 cars be able to drive on autopilot 90 percent of the time. but only time willl tell and get us closer to inovate more technology each decade.",4,1621350000000.0,36,42,ecause ,Unannotated,Unannotated 1,,,,,Indiana,Text dependent,"""Driverless Cars are Coming""",Driverless cars,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

Owning a driverless car could be extremly helpful. Driverless cars will still require a driver who is paying attention to the road at all times. These cars could helpful, of course you would still have to pay attention to the road but you could relax more and not be as stressed out as you would when you are driving. There are negatives to owning a driverless car such as you, a driver or passanger, may not be safe. Technology can always have a fault, what if one of these cars drove you into the other lane causing you to hit a car or you run off into a ditch. What happens when to cars hit eachother, who is at fault. The driver is at fault of course, the drivers need to be in control of the cars.

I think we should just keep our cars the way they are, I would feel more safe on the road with the car's control in my hands.

When I saw the title of this story I thought driverless cars would be amazing but as I continued to read through it, I noticed how bad these cars could be for all of the people. These cars could mess up and get you killed or hurt because you aren't paying attention and you aren't being in full control. I feel like more underage kids would think it would be okay to driver these cars because they don't take as much effort and aren't as difficult to learn about. I also think that some parents would let them too because they think it would be easier, but they are wrong. Driving one of these cars is just as dangerous as driving any other car in the world. It could be dangerous if you make it dangerous.

In my opinion they should not invest in producing driverless cars, what they should do is invest in making cars run off of things like water, air, or from solar energy. That would be much more effective for earth, it would stop global warming becasue it is reducing all of the fumes that are released into the air.

In a classroom students will get confused and often have trouble on the material. The negitive impacts this will have on students is minor, although this technology could help letting teachers know how their emotionally feeling, they still dont know whats the matter, for example say the student is confused, they know the student is confused, but they don't know why, and in most cases thats the difficult to find out.

I personally think that it should be driverless cars because of what it can do to us in the future. Let's say that your'e driving for 4 hours straight with no sleep on a highway and the car takes over if you fall asleep while driving. Well that's when the driverless cars come in handy. So my question is that are driverless cars going to take over in the future?

First, let's talk about how can the cars be driverless. Well Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Google cars aren't completely driverless because someone is actually inside that takes over if it looks like something is in the way. In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. So do you think cars can really be driverless.

Secondly, what can driverless cars do? For the driverless cars it needs a whole lot of sensors so that it can identify where the car is going or what's in the way of the car. Googled modified the Toyota Pruis so that it can be almost like a driverless car with so high tech things on it. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

Lastly, is the cars assisting or are you driving? Sebastian Thrun the founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up the the dream. In the driverless car do you think that you are driving or is it assisting you while you drive the car. I think that the car is assisting you because why would it be called the ""driverless"" car. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Basically what it is that they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves.

In conclusion, do you think driverless cars are going to take over in the future? I think they will because most people will get tired of diving everywhere they go so the driverless cars will help them out. It really started in the late 1950s General Motors created a car that can drive on a special track by itself.

My opinion about the schools new policy of having students with at least a B average to participate in sports is something I would agree on. Sports is like an award for some students who is very active, works hard and puts a lot of effort into their class work. They should deserve a little time to be in something every kid enjoys if they're active. I wouldn't disagree because it wouldn't be fair at all to have kids who don't work hard in school and fools around all day to be joining in fun activities, because it makes them concentrate less in class work and makes them worry more about the activities that's assigned for them in school that has nothing to do with reading, writing and etc.

Even though sports is healthy for kids, a lot of students should be able to attend to those activity's but its worth working hard to earn it.

If a student really wants to join a sport activity, they should work hard and earn something that they really want in order to achieve that. On the other hand, it makes them want to do their work which is a good opportunity because they'll be used to it and concentrate more often till the student gets that chance to be an activity.

I agree with this, because, some students can't learn as fast as other kids in their class and struggle to keep up with their homework and classwork, and when they start to fall so behind they begin to cheat instead of learning and asking for help from their teachers. When you do online school you are able to go your own pace, no friends are there to distract you and there is no one to cheat off of.

Online school can be extremely beneficial to many students, because we are able to go our own pace and learn in the best environment with no distractions from anyone. You learn so much about yourself and prove to yourself that you are capable of so much more when you work hard and stay focused. Students get to feel better about their work when they do good knowing that they worked hard for that grade alone. It gives them more confidence and motivation to do even better on their next assignment.

When you learn in school there is so much pressure to keep up with classwork and homework assignments and students tend to fall off and begin to cheat off their peers, on top of that some students struggle to be on time to their classes and get introuble. When you do online school there is no pressure, no rush and no cheating. Students shouldn't feel the need to skip class, because they felt they weren't ready to take a test or a quiz.

In school students are easily influenced and distracted by their peers in their classes and begin to start conversations when they are not suppose to. Some students tend to get bored of sitting in the same spot and begin to walk around the hallways with friends when they should be in class. Online school doesn't distract you, but only encourages you and push you to better yourself and your future. Doing online schools shows you what subjects you're good in and what subjects you may lack in, online school would break it down for you so that you can have a better understanding.

Students would learn so much more online, because they are allowed to choose what time they get to start school. They are also able to speak to teachers and ask questions they would be nervous to ask in a classroom. Online school allows you to think freely without worrying about what others may say or think of you. In school some students get anxiety when they have to present a project to the class and tend to freeze up, but online school the only person you are presenting to is your teacher and that lowers the stress that some students may feel when presenting to a large group in school.

It can be easy to not attend any of these classes, you could just not show up, do the work , or simply just sleep in. If you dont attend these classes it could lead to serious consequences. These consequences could lead to serious things. It would be better to have a physical class to walk into and attend.

Some students are better learners when you directly speak to someone one on one. Not all Students learn the same, some learn by being up and active such as athletes, mechanics, and others. Students that choose to learn online could also not understand a subject and could end up needing a little more help. Like me, I need a little more help sometimes from teachers so I need a physical class and physical person to help me.

23353,AAAXMP138200001117512144_OR,CFCB45ABFDA6,train,"Summer break is that time of the year where students are fresh out of school. They immediately start what has been planned prior to their break starting, but always forget one thing which is the information that they have been taught. Summer projects happen in some schools, but these projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects allow for students to work in many ways to gain information and students can limit themselves as to how much they want to learn.

There are many ways a student can learn information. An example of this is a site called KhanAcademy which can be used to learn any subject. This site has a lot of information that can be learned, especially when it comes to the people who struggle in math and they can visualize what is being shown through an instructional video on how to do things. Another way to learn during the summer is by reading books and articles online or at a local library. Elementary schoolers to this day still read over the summer and keep track with their reading log in order to improve their reading skills, but some schools offer rewards for learning over summer break. Having a student design their own project can allow them to use as many resouces as they want like each other. A family member, friend, or associate can teach them something they don't know or have struggled on.

Students should be able to limit themselves when trying to learn something new or old, if they do not understand it. Allowing students to do this can help them out on knowing how to prioritze and can help them to become a self starter without needing guidance from a teacher. Some people feel the need to learn more than they do in school because what has been learned can be useful in their daily lives. For example, using the skills learned in a family and consumer science class can be used out in the real world such as how to shop for groceries, take care of clothing, etc. Learning more can essientially make things in life easier while being in and out of school. Information like this can be shared with one another in order for their lives to be easier as well.

Although, student-designed summer projects can show how creative and organized a student can be, not all students are capable of wanting to learn over the summer because they are not motivated enough to do so. They would rather focus on what fun they will be doing during the summer because they feel like enough has been learned throughout the school year. Some students will continue to procrastinate on designing their own project that would be given before the break even starts.

Being able to come back to school next year will be less stressful without trying to remember things that have been forgotten about over a certain period of time. It is always best to stay up-to-date with all the things that are taught. It also feels nice to carry around knowledge known to themselves, but not to others. Students may be updated with their knowledge to the point where they might show their teachers a few things. This is why summer projects should be student-designed.",4,1618590000000.0,475,1130,"There are many ways a student can learn information.

79138,2081006181,D4D35DDC74EB,train,"Dear Principal of our school,

It is my belief that our community could use community service as it helps our school as it not only provides students with a ambition to help their city, but it shows them how good it feels to do something helpful. Also, if the students are out there helping then they may inspire others to do the same. As long as they are out there they aren't wasting away with their lives and succumbing to peer pressure, anything is better.

The feeling to help the environment around us is what we look up to so, not only are we doing ourselves good, we also do good to the young ones that look up to and respect us so that one day they may also aspire to help the environment around them. There are of course dangers that come along with the tough job of helping our community, an example would be, predators prowling the area, this shows that we would need to protect the students while they are working. Also, students may turn a blind eye if they want to help, so they will fit in with their crowd of friends.

With the threat of global warming, the Earth needs all the help it can get, with all the smoking, littering and polluting in general we need to band together and keep our Earth safe.

So all in all, it would be a hard project, helping our community and all, but pulling together we would be able to do it.

Sincerely, just another student looking out for the Earth,

You can get seriously hurt from a car accident so please stay off your phones.

Being on cell phones have cost many people life changing injuries or even worse. While you are in the driver's seat you shouldn't even have your phone in sight. Don't put your phone on your lap or any place where it can be easily accessed. Just having your phone in arm reach would make you want to pick it up. When you are on the road you should give the road your full attention and do not look at your phone, you might think that it's okay to look at your phone for a second but that one second could make the difference of life or death.

People get scars from being in a wreck both mentaliy and physically. Some may not walk again some do walk but with the help of therapy.

The way think this should work is when students miss behave they are sent to ISS. Well when their are in ISS and done with their assignments then they should be sent monitored outside the school building and clean up all the trash this way they will think before they miss behave this will also be helping the community. Another way this could work is by providing a community service class to all of those who wish to help in community service. Also the school can add an after school program in witch students are allowed to stay after school and clean up the school and communities that surround the area .I also think that in order to help this problem the principles should set up a meeting with all of the students and explain to them the importance if having a clean community.

However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, with the exception of a $40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use.

While it may make getting places harder, the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones.

First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emmissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many enviornments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanantly cripple our planet. Any way that we can cut the effects of global warming should be implemented.

Secondly, crowded cities benefit in many ways from a lessening of driving. Some cities, like Paris, have already had to enact a partial ban on driving due to a heavy smog layer. Other cities, like Beijing, is even more polluted, and cities in this country suffer as well. If less people drove, the air would be clearer, as was the case in Paris.

Also, there is less crowding when less people are driving. Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows just how bad congestion and traffic jams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with even-numbered liscence plates, congestion went down sixty percent.

Finally, using an alternative to cars can save money.

When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. For an example, the person that you ask might have the exact advice you were looking for. Their advice might be a ton better than another person's. Last example, their advice might be extremely helpful.

The person that you ask might have the advice you were looking for. That could be the advice to ask people personal questions. It also could be the advice you needed to have courage and stand up for yourself. People have the advice you might need to learn you self manners. Like your parents, they don't always give the advice you want so, that is why you dont be embarrassed to ask for advice.

Sometimes, another advice might be a ton better than one another. Some people have different opinions. So, that means you will have to ask more people until you agree with them. I asked my dad for advice to tell my friend that I was responsible for his phone at the pool, and it fell into the water and tore up. My dad said,''Just go tell your friend what happened and apologize.'' My dad's advice he gave me worked my friend forgave me and I bought him a new phone.

However, sometime the advice the person you asked might be extremely helpful. The person you asked might have the same opinions as you but, that might be a bit rare and hard to find them. The person you ask might have the same thoughts about the advice they might give you. Sometimes you might be lucky and luck up to find good advice you need. Its difficult to get the specific, and certain advice you are looking for.

Finding the advice you need or want is hard. Sometimes, you might have to look up at your older brothers, sisters, and maybe your parents. Advice could be good or bad you just never know what type of advice might get.

Good advice builds up courage to say something or give a speech in front of hundreds of strangers.

13143,5028611,1D0E0C228813,train,"Ever wondered how the streets of a very popullated city would look like? For example, Miami. At night Miami is full buildings that stand out in color, and on the highways you can see a whole road full of lights, the thing with these lights is that they are cars, even though they are helpful by getting us from point A to point B, they are the second highest source of pollution in the United States, that is after power plants. The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole ""car-free"" thing is become more and more popular all over the world.

In Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go car-free. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" (Source 1). 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly car-free except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beatiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. ""Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Souce 1). Miami is a car-intensive area, I know this from personal experince, there is always traffic during the day. I've been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it's something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn't stars, it's how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.

Paris, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn't run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"" (Source 2). Even though some didn't listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"" (Source 2). Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we'll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this car-free thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.

""BOGOTA, Colombia - In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3). Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one car-free day, in Bogota called ""Day Without Cars"", this was the third year actually, on this ""car-free"" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3). If you've ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.

In the United States, research shows ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Source 4). This meaning that adolescents aren't as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren't even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can't make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can't pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4).

And why is it good that u ask other people for their opinion is because it can help people feel good about theirselvs and what i mean by that is most of the time no one cares about your opinion or theres and asking them for their opinion can really impact their life a lot because you probably brighten their day by putting a smile on their face.

Another way it help is that it improves your ability to talk to other people, say if your shy and dont talk to nobody try going around asking people for their opinion on something and you ask how that can improve your ability to talk to people well it improves your ability to talk to people without being scared it really works because the more you do it the less afraid you are to talk to people.

And also asking for other people opinions can help you make friends because when you ask for their opinion they probably want to ask you a question or they probably was thinking about the same question you asked but didnt have anyone to ask because they dont have friends either and now yall are friends and more friends are better than one.

so thats why i think asking multiple people for their opinion is better than just asking one person because it can help you get friends, improve your ability to talk to people,and it makes them fool good about themselves.",2,1618030000000.0,186,193,because ,Unannotated,Unannotated 1,,,,,Virginia,Independent,,Seeking multiple opinions,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.",4,1620930000000.0,3250,3321,"Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.

I also think that asking more than one person is a great thing, because seeking multiple opinions can help make better choices, make sure all the facts are right, or if someone is wrong about something.

The way seeking multiple opinions and help you make better choices is by one person my say all these good thing about one collage and another person might tell say the complete opposite of that. Even if that wasn't enough to make the decision which collage to go to it would never hurt to get a third opinion. It can also be at a job that may not be the best but just by getting someone else say in that job it could possibly change anyone point of view on that job and it could help them make their decision easier. Adults and young adults may need help by picking a new car out, because car are really expensive and there is a lot to look at like the gas, how many miles, and the amount the car cost. Those are big things to look at when buying a car and a young adult may not know about all those things so they my just ask their mom, dad, or even their grandparents. With young adults they can make some pretty bad decisions and serious ones to like taking drugs. Many teems think that taking drugs wont effect them or they wont get addicted but before they think about doing drugs they should ask a trusting friend that is a good influence and hear what they have to say.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can be help is when doing a paper and looking at different web sites. When on Wikipedia not all their fact are true, because anyone one can go on there and put whatever they want to. So thats its always good to go to more than one website when researching something. In school not all the teachers think alike clause when asking for help by one teacher they my tell you this is the answer but when going to another teacher they may think other wise but this doesnt always happen because most of the teachers know what their doing.

The last way seeking multiple opinions can also help with small thing like picking out clothes or what bag of chips to get. It may just seem like a bag of chips but when asking one friend to see if the new pringles chips are good or not and they say no but your other friend says they are the best thing in the world. So then when asking your third friend they say they are the best thing to so when trying them they were actually the best thing ever. Its little things like that can make change someones future because now their kids are going to grow up eating those chip and so on.

Driving is very convenient in this time and age. Not only is driving convenient but also a prominent way of transportation everywhere. Driving has many good effects on society today but can be dangerous and in many ways even fatal. Something that has a big effect on driving is the smartphone people keep with them every day all day. Texting and driving has been consistently taking the lives of drivers behind the wheel. Texting and driving should not be allowed in this time in age nor in the future.

Texting and driving comes with the ultimate risk being a life. Many people, teens especially, are losing their lives in car accidents. The cause of these car accidents could be avoided if these people were not texting while driving. The text states ""...the number of auto fatalities has remained stable, at about 40,000 deaths a year. The US Department of Transportation estimates that 6,000 of those are the result of distracted driving."" The textual evidence shows that phones and driving can be a large factor in deaths while driving. The most important part is how the phones are killing off these people.

When texting and driving is occurring at the same time it forces the driver to multitask. Some evidence states ""Driving and cell phone conversations both require a great deal of thought. When doing them at the same time, your brain is unable to do either well."" Multitasking is already hard on people and then their attention span makes texting and driving an even worse idea. In the text it states ""According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the average attention span of a human being has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds in 2013"". This evidence shows that humans already have a short attention span, so imagine a younger person with a weaker mind texting and driving.

The texting while driving epidemic has its biggest effect on the younger people. The youths are more likely to have and be using a smartphone while driving than elders. This is supported by the claim ""Younger age groups are also much more likely to use social media sites like Facebook than older ones."" This shows that youths are more likely to be affected by the epidemic of texting and driving. In the text it also states ""In every country surveyed, those under 35 are more likely to own smartphones, to use the internet and to use social media than those ages 50 and older."" Smart phones have more of an influence on younger people as seen in the text.

Texting and driving is something that would not benefit anyone if it were allowed. Not only should texting and driving not be allowed but it should be outlawed. This epidemic has already claimed the lives of so many people. People all over the world are losing their lives and sustaining permanent injuries from texting and driving. This needs to be stopped permanently by being outlawed and kept out of mind.

As we go further into the future, more improvements on cars are being made each day. One major invention is the driverless car. The development of the driverless car is a good thing because it is convenient, safe, fuel-saving, and beneficial to our knowledge on cars.

Many people are always needing to travel from place to place and don't always want to drive. It's more convenient to just hitch a ride from someone such as a friend or a taxi. But sometimes those aren't always the most convenient options. Taxi drivers could take someone anywhere or your friend could be under the influence. Driverless cars are safer because they could take you where you need to go safely. They are also more convenient because sometimes people could be impaired and unable drive, so they would just have a driverless car pick them up instead. This way, it is convenient for people to travel without worrying if they are going to be safe or not.

A main factor in people buying cars is if they are safe. According to the article on Driverless Cars Are Coming, these independent cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. People could be safer in a driverless car than with someone driving a car. Safety is a huge deal in our society and people buying cars want what's best for them and their families. If driverless cars are safer, companies will have good sales and produce better profit. This way, the economy is being benefitted and so is society.

In the world today, we try to conserve our resources as much as possible. Fuel is a major resource that is used to power a lot of things in everyday life. By using driverless cars, we would limit our use of fuel to half of what taxis use, and that is phenomenal. Inventions like the driverless car can lead to preserving resources. Conserving our resources is an important thing we need to do, and fundamental developments like the driverless car can help us achieve our goal in doing that.

The research on these cars is significant for people in the future. Many years ago we would have never known all the important things about technology that we know today. By researching and testing the technology of the driverless car, we have produced more efficient knowledge for the future. Driverless cars need sensors to operate similar to a human driving the car, which is important to creating cars. Without researching and inventing these important products, we wouldn't have half the knowledge on cars that we have today.

Driverless cars are beneficial to us because they are convenient, safe, fuel-saving, and important to our knowledge on cars. Driverless cars can help people in society and people in the future. The development of these cars can influence people to create even bigger things in the future and that is incredible. The future is brighter than it has ever been, and the development of such a product has made this possible.

Scientist's said it was just a natural landform.

For the second time, the scientist could yet again reach Cydonia once again to turn their conspiracy theory to fact. Others back on Earth said it was too windy and it made the clouds affect the picture. This time researchers used a maximum resolution camera to prove the theorists wrong.

Scientist said that the ""face"" was equivalent to a butte or mesa. They made this staement because there is something similar to it on Earth in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These are found around the American West. Garvin said, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the ""Face on Mars.""

On the other side of things, there were many conspiracy theorists that questioned NASA's claim. Everyone wasn't satisfied with the pictures that were first taken people said it was during a cloudy season, that's why there was another trip with more advanced equipment. They also stated that the camera on board had to go through the clouds and dust to see the face so the picture couldn't been shown clearly. Another claim they made is that since there were wispy clouds the alien markings could be hidden in the haze and scientists just didn't look hard enough.

In conclusion we have the facts that we need to prove that "" The Face"" is just a natural landform. We have provided the public with two pictures. Plus we also made observations that it looked like a landform from here on Earth.

There has been many discussions on how teachers and educators can reach out to their students and make the learning experince more accessible. Some schools have taken the approach for online schooling so the student can work at home while still doing their work and classes. I think students can benefit from doing online school because it lets them work in a more pleasant environment and can get rid of some of the distractions that come from other classmates.

Students can benefit from doing their work at home from being in a more comfterable environment. Being in a school setting can make students stressful from all the other classmates judgment. Classes are filled with up with many different types of people and some don't always understand the material as well as the rest. This can lead to insecurities and fearfulness of being judge by others, and this can also lead to less focus on the subject and more of what others think of you. Students will also feel more comfterable from working at their house because it is where most people go when they want to get away and relax. A persons home has everything you own and you know it very well, which makes it a place of comfort. Working at home is a positive way to get away from the judgment of others and also be in ones safe space for accomplishing tasks.

A regular school classroom can have a lot of distractions in them. Trying to get work done in a classroom can be changing at times from the other peers. There is also a cliche class clown that likes to crack jokes but can drive the attention away from what people should really be doing at the moment. People like this can change the whole mood of the room and the rest of the class can just lose motivation of working on the assignment. If students were able to do school online though , there would be none of that because they would just be at home doing the assignments with no one else. Some Classrooms can also have a room full of close friends making it hard to not talk or get off task. While the teacher can try and separate the group of close friends there can still be interaction and even more distraction for the rest of the class. Students can have more focus for doing online school from being able to get away from distracting classmates.

Parents or older relative can disagree on this issue from wanting the students to have a classic education. The thought of having more students work and take their classes at home can seem daunting to older relatives from the thought that they weren't given that option at their age or that the educational system just shouldn't change at all. The reality is that as time goes on things ,such as schools, are going to evolve for the better and without change things won't grow and lead to more success. The idea that schooling will be on someones computer could seem like an out of this world plan but if it will better the students education and mental health then they should be open to the change.

Online schooling will benefit a students from being a safe environment to work and having less distractions from their classmates. A persons house is an area where we don't feel judge and can fully relax. Working in a classroom can lead to class clowns and close friends driving attention away from the task at hand. With all of the new found technology we are able to do this and if it is going to improve the educational system then it should be given to the students who truly need it. ",5,1621640000000.0,0,343,What can schools do to better their students educational experience?

Just imagine if you could take a class that would support you greatly in your future pursuits. Truthfully, we already have them; they are online classes. For example, my school district, Generic_School, has Virtual Generic_School. In these classes, students are able to fulfill credits or take classes that help students gain knowledge on a certain topic. Unfortunately, there is a debate about students having the option of attending class online, but based on my experience, online classes are highly beneficial towards the students because they aid the personal pursuits of the student and teach students a higher level of independence.

Firstly, attending classes online from home aids in the personal pursuits of the student. For example, some of my classmates that are Seniors will take the Physics Honors class on Virtual Generic_School, so they are able to take a job during their Early Release block(students are able to leave early to pursue other interests.) When Seniors are able to take a job, they are able to gain funds to attend the college of their choice. This is greatly helpful because in college tuition is rising, and many former college students say, ""they lack the funds to pay for college tuition."" Due to this, an online class provides time for the student to pay for their college tuition in a proper manner. Additionally, I took a Virtual Generic_School Course on Personal Finance and Economics, so I could get an Early Release for my Senior Year. Thankfully, I was successful in this class; this provided my a free extra period in which I will use to volunteer at the Generic_City Hospice, so I can gain medical experience and aid the community in a positive manner. As you can see, attending online classes from home greatly enhance the possibility that a student can pursue their personal pursuits aiding them in a great positive manner.

Furthermore, online classes are supporting a student to learn a higher aspect of independence. For example, the student is not being forced towards waking up and coming to class. In this case, the student must have the desire to continue the class. This demonstrates the ideal of drive, and employers want to see that you have the initiative to complete tasks because this proves that the employee truly cares about the success of the company and has a great sense of drive. Also, my online class on Personal Finance and Economic taught me a great level of time management. During this time, I had a family trip and many guitar events coinciding with my online class. Due to this, I had to manage my time at an extremely high level which supported me to finish the class before the due date. As a matter of fact, this learning of time management made me understand the value of time and how to use it in a more efficient manner. This aided me greatly in sophomore year because the classes that I took were of higher rigor, but I was still able to increase my GPA and pursue my personal interests because of the level of time management that I had learned. Time management is greatly needed in independent life because without time management, there would be chaos in life, we would never be able to manage work and personal life causing a great deal of stress within us. In conclusion, these examples show that online classes provide the student with a learned sense of independence.

Many supporters of not implementing an online class, say, ""online classes are going to cause students to forget about the old, classic way of teaching."" While this may be true, we are in a society that is changing rapidly, and we need to benefit ourselves in the greatest possibility. Even if that means that we must switch our teaching styles. In the technology era, we are required to use the computer and understand its functions at a great level; the online classes are some of the best providers of understanding technology at a higher level. This could provide our students to be more capable in the workforce, so they can gain more opportunities and a higher level of success among their peers.

In conclusion, online classes are highly beneficial towards students because they aid students to strive for their personal pursuits, garner a higher level of independence, and keep us on track in a very rapid changing society. These classes are highly beneficial, and the success created by online classes highly outweigh any negatives that may be caused by online classes. Now, we should stop imagining us having online class and begin to implement these classes because without our implementation, this could cause a great deal of failure within our society.",5,1621550000000.0,1930,2023,"Furthermore, online classes are supporting a student to learn a higher aspect of independence ",Claim,Claim 4,Adequate,1621550000000.0,online classes are highly beneficial towards the students ,Position,Virginia,Independent,,Distance learning,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

At this day and age, it certainly seems like the technology has updated to a point of these driverless cars could be possible. Now we have to argue a new question. Should driverless cars become a reality? Will they do more harm than good? Driverless cars should stay a fantasy due to saftey, expense, and laziness.

Human operated cars have already caused a tremendous number fatal accidents. Who is to say that these machine run cars will do any better? We have learned that machines are not always consistent in their actions. What would happen if these driverless cars malfunctioned and caused an accident? If they hit a person? What were to happen if a driver falls asleep at the wheel, and the cars fails to alert them? Who would be at fault? These driverless cause would cause the government to make revisions to our laws. Driverless cars are not a guaruntee to public saftey.

Driverless cars require much more technology than non-driverless cars do. This would raise the price of cars tremedously. Not only would one have and expensive car, but one would have to dish even more money out to fill it with gas. As the article ""Driverless Cars Are Comming,"" states, sensors, GPS receivers, and 3-D modeling and much more would be put into the car. This technology would make the car safer but would also increasde it's price. The article also states that some manufacturures have built special roads that would keep the car on course. It goes on to state that this would be an expensive update to preexisiting roads everywhere. There just is not enough money for these cars to be placed on the market.

Driverless cars would add the pile of laziness that has built up over the years. As technology advances, humans use it to create items to make life easier. Cars themselves were invented to make travel easier. Human no longer want to have to work for anything. We want to be able to snap our fingers and get what we want. If these driverless cars were to be produced, they would decrease physical activity even more than before. Now all the driver would have to do is sit back and relax. Driverless cars would cause humans to be even more unhealthy than before.

Driverless cars should stay a fantasy due to saftey, expense, and laziness. They would cause us to revise laws incase of an accident. They would cost more than they're worth.

Would your life be hectic? I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activity For example, time is something that passes all the time. Not all of the students can get a ride, adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. In all, adding extracurricular actives is a bad idea.

Time. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle. Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air.

buses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figure out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride.

Sols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed.

Our world today mostly depends on computers and machines to do most of everything. Many inventors and scientist have discovered so many technological things and as the years progress, we get smarter and smarter and come up with more discoveries. Since we depend so much on technology, its a norm to use it, so mostly everything scientist, inventors and doctors come up with is valuable or useful.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of this new technology the Facial Action Coding System, has worked with many other scientist and doctors to create this technology, that enables computers to identify human emotions. This is a very valuable technology that our world needs today. There are plus and down sides to this argument of the technology being valuable or not. It is valuable because it can be use for many things throughout the world, for example paragraph 6 states, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This technology would help the teacher see what he or she needs to do to be able to make the class more exciting to make students learn and pay attention more. Paragraph 8 states, "" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" The technology would be valuable in a situation like an important election, where if a person running for something is lying about something, you would be able to tell using the help of the FACS.

In conclusion there are many reasons why we should or should not use the Facial Acting Coding System. We depend on technology most of the time, so this would be just another cool addition to our collection of discoveries we already have. Knowing the exact emotion of your mom, dad or friend from a computer software, would be very useful to see if there telling the truth or not.

With the developement of autonomous vehicles there are less drunk driving accidents and less reckless driving accidents.

With more and more teenagers learning to drive and getting their license the number of reckless driving accidents from teens have skyrocketed over the last five years.

As well as the increased risk of drunk drivers, which is always a problem but even with those risks taken care of; the car itself has some serious safety issues and economic issues.

With the American economy always fluctuating from good to bad this new developement could end up causing a huge disadvantage in some of our lower class citizen workers.

""...a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system""(1).

However with that in mind the ammount of low income jobs, such as the taxi drivers, would end up erraticated would be to large to count and more americans could quite possibly fall below the poverty line once again.

Also the article states that right now there is no such thing as a driverless car but a driver assitence car.

These cars can drive by themselves 90% of the time, except in special circumstances like road construction and accidents.

With cars like this they still require an aware driver at all times and the car needs a way a communicating with the driver when to take over.

""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in daanger of backing into an object.

Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays""(7).

However with these warning systems in place they should help the driver but instead these warnings could scare the driver.

What if a drunk man was in the drivers seat because his car can drive on its own so he believed it was safe, but he is told to take over by his vibrating chair.

WIth that man not being in his right state of mind in a special situation, such as a cinstruction zone or accident where you are suppose to be extra careful can cause more harm then good.

Finally there is the problem of eventually if there is an accident with a driverless car because the systems failed, who would be at fault the passenger in the car or the manufacturers.

16053,5352149,F10B5A59FE18,train,"There are many reasons why reducing the need for transportation by car would help solve many problems. Cars cause many major environmental issues. Cars also cause many health issues, seeing that they encourage motorized transportation, instead of the human body's own two-legged system of getting from point 'A' to poit 'B'. Many authors have wrote about cases where some places in the world are trying to see how becoming a car-free zone would help the economical, environmental, and health related issues caused by vehicles such as cars.

Elizabeth Rosenthal explains that a German experiment is already happening where the country have created a city where there are little to no vehicals driving down the roads without punnishment. In the passage I recently read, by Rosenthal, titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", she talks about how Vauban, Germany residents are playing the most important role in an experimental project that prohibits things like street parking, driveways, and home garages. The district has also moved nessecary places (grocery stores, etc.) a lot ""closer-to-home"" in order to make them be within walking distances of peoples' houses. This is done as a way to essentially eliminate the use of vehicles to get from place to place. One man, Heidrun Walter, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" He is one of many participants of this experiment who shows that terminating vehical use in countries will possibly make a lot of people happier and it will also cause the air around us to be nearly free of pollutes and toxins that we possibly inhale on a daily basis, as suggested in paragraph #5 of Rosenthal's passage.

Benefits from car bans are also discussed in Robert Duffer's passage called, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"". Paragraph #10 of this passage states, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban..."", meaning that the amount of polluted air in the effected countries and cities went down to a controllable amount after the ban had taken place. Therefore, this passage is even more evidence that cars being eliminated from public use is a very good thing for the environment.

Although kids would love to sit on the couch and play video games or text on their phones, they should know how precious it is to help the earth and others out. The time it would take to give community service is very subordinate compared to all the time the kids & teens spend playing video games and texting. They should realize that their later lives are going to be impacted by the way they act now. If they are indolent and wont help the community, how are they going to be able to survive in our hrsglive when they don't live with their parents anymore?

To answer your question, Yes i do believe that kids should be obligated to perform community service every month for 2 or 3 hours. The two hours it takes to do the community service will be very deficient compared to all the time they spend on the couch or texting.

By doing community service the child would gain physically and mentally. He or She will be physically active while he or she does their job. He or she will gain knowledge greatly appreciated in later years. Like how to cook and clean, and how to plant and use the foods you grow. There are many life skills that can be used in the child's later years.

My final conviction is, yes i believe that it is the new generations necessity to stand up and say that they WANT to give to the community in servitude.",3,1614880000000.0,640,770,"To answer your question, Yes i do believe that kids should be obligated to perform community service every month for 2 or 3 hours.

149810,AAAXMP138200000962822125_OR,99AE27FBECA2,train,"Is online school beneficial to students? Should it be allowed to students? Online school is used to help students make up classes that they failed or didn't take during the school year. Some students even want to graduate early which means students are interested in online classes. Others might want to free some spaces for another class. A majority percentage of students even think its easier to do online school than public school.

One benefit of online school is students can finish any of the modules or lesson given early or late and still receive a good grade. Online students should be given a long period of time to finish assignments and projects because students can spend time thinking or researching about the assignment that was assigned.

Students in public schools are given less than a week to finish assignments which case stress and anxiety. Students are afraid that their projects or assignment is not good enough because of the short completion period. Public school students are given one class to do a entire lesson which is not a lot of time to be taught about a certain topic. Online school students can finish the lesson at a their pace which can reduce stress. Researchers found it shocking that students that attend online school tend to have a better grade than public school students because of the time given to students.

Second benefit of online school is it should be allowed for students to advances in core classes and electives. Students should also be given to opportunity to retake a class over the summer.

Why is taking a class better in the summer than during the school year? Classes tend to be less stressful during the summer than online classes during the school year because of summer break. Class during the school years are more stressful because sharing a online class with classes at school tends to build up stress which is not good for mentality. Students retaking a class over the summer is a good thing because it helps them relearn the main material that was learned from previous classes. It should also help the student know what they did wrong in the past and help them pass the class. This is a good thing because students can use the material they learned online and use it in the future.

Third benefit of online school is students can access the class anytime anywhere and you can ask for help easily. This is very beneficial because students can easily access the class with a click of a button. Students can access the class if they have extra time to spare, coming back from a sports event , and a important meeting for a club. It could also be accessed during vacation break when you're in a car ride to a water park or Disneyland and you want to get some assignments done before the fun. Students can also seek help by taking advantage of the video conferencing system. Students are on the video chat to interact with the teacher and the lesson so its easier to type a question. Students can also email the teacher of the class and ask for help or a question.

Some might say that public school is a better option for education but that saying is not true because online school has proven to many parents and students that it is a less stress zone and more beneficial to students. Students have a lot of time to finish assignments online. They can spend time at home with the parents while they do school work. Public school has nothing but offered stress and anxiety to many students.          ",5,1620930000000.0,1353,1544,Second benefit of online school is it should be allowed for students to advances in core classes and electives.

I sped up towards the goal. I lift my leg and shoot and my ball hits the net within second. The crowd cheering my teammates gathered around me. We just won the first championship game for Generic_School. This is commonly known as extracurricular activities that are offered and put together by the schools. We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities.

One of the reasons we should have these activities for students is because they can improve social skills. For example if you were running down the court and your teammate on the other side you can communicate to them ""Pass I'm open!"". According to activitesforstudents. org having children and students be on a team can improve many things teamwork abilities,social skills, along with confidence. But some people argue that having these teams and a type of competitiveness which can cause kids to be rude and be unkind to the other teammates who they think is ""not good enough"". A true story from americanantibullysociety. org. about a young boy who was home schooled and very shy. He later came to public school where he sat alone at lunch and didnt talk to anyone. A few months later he joined the yearbook staff. He became very social and everyone wanted to be his friend. He later realized that having these connections at school is a necessity. This really puts in perspective why we should have extracurricular activities.

Another reason that we should have this rule is because it can help you become more involved with the school system. An article titled ""Children need extracurricular activities!"" claims that doing these activities can decrease the number of children and teens led into mental problems or social skills. A website called USAschools. com stated that in just the last year the number of kids who arent in activities at school end up being indoors and isolating themselves which could lead to no friends and could lead to larger more severe problems. Having these activities will attract more students to join new schools if they have good sport teams or any of there other interests.

Some people argue that school should only be for academics. There wrong because although schools are for learning new concepts in math,science, civics and more doesnt mean students should not have the opportunity to join a yearbook staff or a sports team. on the other hand, maybe we shouldnt have these activities because the schools already put enough money into teaching kids do we need to spend more money on this activities?

I think that we should have this rule because these activities help in so many ways not just inside of school but outside to!

Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.

Musical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.

Musical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.

Another great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.

Finally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.

I stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.          ",4,1619190000000.0,2886,3044,"with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.

The driverless cars are not always a good thing though, because people feel the freedom of driving and love driving.

People also could have driver less taxi cabs, because of that over thousands of people would loose there jobs as a taxi driver.

There are people who agree with driverless cars, because if they are on a long trip and they have been driving all night and they fall asleep, and with the driverless car they are still safely on there way to there destiantion.

driverless cars will change the world, but sometimes that is not a good thing.

As I mentiond before there are tons of taxi and bus drivers across the United States and the world.

Now imagion all of those people who are working to support there family, and now they get fired because the new driverless taxi or driverless bus came out and took them all out of the job.

People would not get to experience the freedom of driving.

My reasoning is I love that feel of freedom, and the feel of the open road.

People share a connection with there car weather it be they proposed to someone in it or they had there first kiss in it or it was the first time they went to an amusment park, no mater the case you share a connection with it.

96380,AAAOPP13416000036679,8F6F0CD4986A,train,"Driverless cars could be the future of our generation. Many car companies have taken this idea and are trying to pursue it. They are cars that, eventually, will drive by themselves. It seems like a very creative and speechless innovation. However, there are many questionable aspects of the car that need to be taken into account. I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

Drivers today have to go through intensive studying and classes just to gain a license. They think of it as the first step into adulthood and freedom. If driverless cars do take over our population, that will disapear. Teens will look past the greatness of being able to drive, and will look for another way to gain the freedom that they are desperatley seeking for. They also will not have anything that they are in complete control of. In the article it says, ""He envisions a future with a public-transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system."" If this happens, teens would not be in conrol of the car, the car would. That leaves kids to rely on yet another thing in their lives. Teens already have to rely on many things everyday. I think that if we add another one, and take away that sense of freedom, we will be taking away a big part of life. This is one reason I do not think driverless cars are a good idea.

Another reason I disagree with them is because of safety. Technology should not be relied on for big tasks like driving. Car companies are being thourough and making sure they are safe, but technology, even today, still seems to occasionally mess up. In the article it says, ""Most drvining laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" I agree that the best way to ensure safety is with a driver that is focused and knowledged. These driverless cars could potentially be dangerous to us. If the car messes up even once, or the company makes a mistake in the programming, we could definately be in great danger. Safety is the most important thing, and because we can never be 100% sure that technology won't mess up, we should not have driverless cars in the future.

The final reason I do not think that we should be excited for driverless cars is because of the law. If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky.

These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

132336,2221007811,5219253594A2,train,"Dear Principle,

I sincerely hope you will not have to take such severe actions as to ban cell phones from school no matter what because that truly would not be a good idea. I think you should allow students to bring their phones and permit them to use their phones during free periods and lunch periods as long as they aren't disturbing people in class, which won't happen because you will make students turn their phones off during class and/or take them from them during class and give the phones back after class. This would cause the students to pay attention no matter what, even though the students already do pay attention.

Taking away all phone privileges would be wrong a dangerous very, very dangerous. What would happen if an armed person came into the school and the school's telephone lines were cut? There would be no way to contact the police or anybody to help with the situation. I say this because if students aren't allowed to have phones teacher's shouldn't be able to have phones at school either. That would be unequal rights, a form of segregation, so to speak. Students are not suppose to use phones during school at all and students very rarely break that rule. However, all the time students see their teachers using their phones. That is a bad example because that sends the message to the students that its okay to break the rule and use your phone during school. If you ban phones from students you have to band phones from teachers as well. That brings me back to the beginning of this paragraph. With no phones allowed to students or teachers there would be no way to contact help. That is a very serious problem and that should be more of a concern than whether students can have phones in school or not if they don't use them during class.

Suppose a teacher sees a student with a phone out in class, will happen? The teacher should take the phone away and not give it back until the end of class. No big deal. However you are saying that the teachers don't catch the students using their cell phones during class, well then they should make sure at the beginning of class that there phones are off and that they keep them on their desk so the teacher can see if they are using them or not. Or the teacher could just take everyone's phone at the beginning of class and not have to worry about it. That is a plus because students don't need phones during class anyway. I'm saying that the students don't need phones in class not all together no phones. I am saying this because some students have games on their phones that they can play during open periods or at lunch. That isn't affecting anything or anyone because they have an open period so there is no teacher to annoy by using their phone and they have a ton of time on their hands so they want to make there time fun. The video may have persuaded you the wrong way. Students dont really use there phone that much. Besides most of those examples were during free periods or free time that the student has. That would lead you to believe that the students should be able to use their phones during free time and that cell phones rarely affect the class and or class work.

In the video only one time does it show that a students phone is being used during class. The others are in the hallway, outside, or in a place where their phones won't disturb anyone around them. That is a big positive. Students don't try to annoy teachers they, it just happens that sometimes a random student gets bored and uses their phone but that only happens like once or twice.

98936,AAAOPP13416000024394,EC0A95423E9C,train,"My position on the driverless cars after reading this article is that I am against them. I am against them for many reasons. The first one being that if the driver is not ready to take over the wheel at any one point and time they could end up crashing the car or something else bad happening. My second reason is that why have a driverless car if it doesn't know how to navigate through road work or accidents on the road. After I am done telling you my side I will then tell you the reason I think the driverless cars can be a good thing and then finish it off with a conclusion.

My first reason for being against the driverless cars is that if the driver in the car isn't ready at all times to take over the wheel he or she could end up getting hurt or hurting someone else and it wouldn't even be thier fault. I think if it's a driverless car it should be a driverless car the person in the car should be able to be doing whatever they wawnt inside the car while the car drivers for them. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requres."" The human driver shouldn't have to be ready and any point and time i think the car should be able to handle everything road work, accidents anything.

My second reason is why have the driverless car if it doesn't know how to go through the road work or accidents. I think it should know how to go thru the road work, accidents, and all the traffic around the town or on the highways. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The car should know how to do this stuff on it's own or it's not really a driverless car. You still always have to be ready ""just in case"". So what if you need to do seomthing on the way to where ever your going and you cant do it because you have to be ready in case you need to take over the wheel.

But on the other side being for the driverless cars there are a lot of very good things that can come from using the driverless cars. One good thing about the car is that they have a lot of sensors and cameras on them. They also thought of a good way to make sure that the human driver in the car is prepared to take over. "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" There are also other options "" Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up display."" People were also thinking about a camera that watches the human driver watching the road so that they are remaining focused on the road at alll times.

In conclusion I have told you that I am against the driverless cars as of right now. I am against them because if the human driver in the driverless car is not ready to take over the wheel at anytime things could go wrong. Alsomy second reason is i think they should be able to steer through traffic, road work and accidents.

150867,AAAXMP138200001957322125_OR,4698AB6B27C5,train,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online courses or video conferencing. While lots of people view this option as an accomplishment, others dislike the idea of having to sit at a computer and do schoolwork all day long. Many people believe that online schools can actually be damaging to a student rather than helpful, because it is less interactive than a physical school, causes students to stare at computer screens, which can damage eye sight, and has the possibility to crash or shut down, whereas a physical classroom would not encounter these issues. An actual school would appropriately strengthen a child rather than a digital school.

If there is one thing that every parent knows about children, it is that they love to move. They love to play games and have fun with their friends. They love to do anything that is interactive and can get them to move around just a little more. An online school, unfortunately, does not offer this to a child. When working on an class online someone would have to sit still in a chair, staring at a computer screen without very much movement. That could be harmful to a child because, usually, they cannot sit still for a long period of time. This is only going to cause an increase of energy in them without them letting it out of their system and, sometimes, loss of concentration. When I took an online course in French I would work half the day on the computer until I was just too tired to work anymore. Sitting at a computer for hours mentally exhausted me. Not only will it exhaust the student, but it also isolates the child from other students. Typically, these online classes take place for one individual student. This, in turn, teaches them not to socialize with other children and fails to let kids make friends, whereas physical classrooms endorse these behaviors in students at a young age.

Not only does online schooling effect a student's physical health, it can effect their cognitive health as well. Studies at the NYU Medical School have shown that 46% of children under twelve years old who stare at digital screens for long periods of time are more likely to experience vision loss in their eyes later on in life. Dr. Theresa Summers even said that, ""The radiation from the screen can possibly do some permanent damage to someone's eyes that may need surgery to completely fix."" Because parents let their children have so much access to technology at such a young age they do not realize how hurtful it can be for their eyes in their later years. So while exposing a young prodigy to online courses seems to be a great option mentally, it can actually do more harm than good.

Online school resource are also not very dependable. Sometimes, technology can fail and crash. Many people have lost progress or assignments because a internet connection was lost or a computer program crashed. This can really set the student back in their class. When I took my online class in French many of the videos I had to watch for assignments were not able to load no matter how many times I tried, which forced me to turn in my work incomplete. This significantly brought my grade down in that class. It is hard to understand the technology that is supposed to help you finish your work on time and frustrating when it doesn't work, which then only adds more stress on the student.

Online school is, unfortunately, not a very wise option for any child to enroll in school. While it does have very positive aspects, such as a personalized learning program and an online chat with a teacher, a more traditional route would be a safer and less stressful option.

Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.

If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new. Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.

The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.

Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.

Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseverance and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.

We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",4,1618880000000.0,610,724,"Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.

132216,2021007432,30D1C9635C0C,train,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think we should be allowed to use out cell phones during lunch or when we have a free period, because if we need to call our parents to come pick us up because we're sick, or we've gotten hurt, we should be able to.

Or if we just want to get in touch with friends, who also have a free period.

If we were able to use our phones when we have free time, there wouldn't be as many kids trying to be sneaky about texting in class.

To begin with, the nurse has a lunch right when we do.

She wont let you into the clinic unless you have a pass from your teacher.

Except, if you fall outside on the patio, or you get sick, there isn't going to be a teacher to write you a pass.

There also isn't going to be a nurse to call your parents for you.

This sounds like a pretty good time to be able to use your cell phone.

Just last year, when I was in 7th grade,

I was running a all day and I was trying to wade it out to see if I could make it through the day.

I tried to go to the clinic, but she wasn't there, and I threw up on the patio.

Had I been able to use my cell phone, I could have had my mom come pick me up.

Also, what if you get hurt out on the patio, such as a fall the cuts your knee wide open.

when there's no nurse, what are you going to do?

I believe this is a reason to think about when considering the cell phone policy.

Teenagers love to communicate.

What better way then with a cell phone?

Now, I know what you're thinking, but I'm not talking about allowing us to have out phones out during classes.

We need to focus on out education.

That's what those core classes are for.

But during lunch, or an elective, if our friends have a free period as well, what would the harm be in texting them?

It's not like we're distracting them from learning math, or science, or another important class.

Just by allowing us to have our phones out for the two or three classes plus lunch we have that aren't core classes, you wouldn't have near as many problems with kids texting in their actual classes.

I believe kids would actually focus more in their class knowing that they don't have to risk getting caught now, when they know there will be a time for them to text later.

When thinking about the cell phone policy for SCHOOL_NAME, I hope you'll take my ideas into consideration.

If kids are sick or hurt, and the nurse isn't there, what are they going do?

Be sick all day?

A quick call or text to mom or dad would help a lot.

Also, during lunch if we could text friends, but turn off the phone during real classes, you would have less of a diciplin",4,1620760000000.0,2210,2590,"When thinking about the cell phone policy for SCHOOL_NAME, I hope you'll take my ideas into consideration.

It allows computers to read emotions based off of muscles. the text says in the third paragraph, "" The process begins when the computer construcks a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human musceks."" It goes more in detail when what we can do, and can even tell a fake smile. The system will help out in many ways then anything else could help out. Facial Action Coding System is valuable for school because it can read the emotisons to tell if someone is understanding it, to show if the people who are learning on that topic enjoy it, and will make people more willing to do something.

First thing that it can do is read the emotsions of the person learn on the topic, then tell if they are getting it or not. If they don't get it, then it can signal the teacher that they need help or to go over it more in detail. This is very good since it will allow the teacher to better understand how his/her teaching methons work as well as if they can move on. The text even says that it can, for example it says, ""'A class room cimputer could recignize when a studen is beciming confused or bored,'"" showing that its not wrong. Being able to know that everyone gets it, and understands what the teacher is getting helps out big time. It could even require no test since everyone would get it, or even let them move on quicker.

The second thing that will be valuable to classrooms that the Facial Action Coding System can do is see if the people learning it is enjoying it. While it might be stupid to think about it, if the people learning as well as the person teaching it enjoys what they are going over they are more likely to want to do it. The text says in paragraph eight, ""But in a false smile, the mouth stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a differnet muscle, the risorius."" This shows that they cant fake a smile to make it look more enjoyable just because it's easy to them. Since it will read, and tell if people are enjoying what is being taught they can do things that everyone will be more willing to do. This will allow the class to move more quickly as well as more effectively.

The last as well as the most important thing the Facial Action Coding System can do is read the emotsions of someone to make them more willing to do something. While it can't do it directly it can however make them more happy, this will make them more willing to. Them being more happy makes them pay more attinsion due to them enjoying it. The text says ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles ot only expresses emotsions, but also may even help produce them."" If it can help produce a smile then it will change emotsions. The changing of emotsions can allow teachers to do some subject that is boring. The subject will become tired then the Facial Action Coding System will know then change the emotsion. Changing this emotsion in a good way will make them more happy, and possibly enjoy it more.

While this system will have many down sides such as cost, people messing with it, and a lot of complants. These are things that come with everything no matter what it is. This Facial Actsion Coding System has so much potintsion that can be used to help the class rooms. Making the students happy with it makes them like school more even. There isn't any good reason or set of reasons that is better not to have it then to have it. The Facial Actsion Coding System is very valuable to students in the class room, and should be used.

What about a planet that at ground level, has far more extreme conditions than humans can handle? This is what exploring our planetary neighbor Venus would be like. Even though the author claims it would be worthy to make the dangerous trip to Venus, he does a poor job of supporting his claim.

The author uses a credible source, NASA, but the author fails to back up why the pursuit is worthy. The information from NASA talks about possible solutions to the harsh conditions of Venus, but not about why the trip should be made, despite all the harsh factors. The text states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" The author has valid reasoning for solutions, but this information does not mention why it would benefit us to risk lives just to make the adventure.

The author also includes an abundance of information about how dangerous and risky Venus is, and yes it is important to know these facts, but in the beginning of the article, the author seems to scare the audience into not traveling to Venus. Paragraph 3 states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" The author goes into detail about just how deadly Venus would be to humans, instead, if he was trying to prove that it is a worthy point, the author should've been lighter about these facts and not gone into such scary, vivid detail; the author also could've added a counterargument in this paragraph instead of waiting until later in the essay to start showing what he was actually trying to prove.

The author could've included more evidence to support his view, but he did provide one piece of sufficient evidence. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This piece shows that some scientists want to explore Venus for its ancient possible ability to explore life, but the author needed to support his claim with other information, other than strictly in this paragraph.

Ultimately, the author did have evidence in his article, but there needed to be more in order to make his claim well-supported and also more credible. Exploring Venus may be a good idea, but the author's claim wasn't clear enough throughout the essay to be able understand his point.

159714,AAAXMP138200000886212810_OR,488DEE769EEF,train,"Why is the world the way it is? Is it this way because one person had one idea that the rest of the world followed or is it this way because multiple people have collaborated and asked for advice overtime? Throughout history many people have come together and shared ideas that have changed the world. For example, many scientists have invented things like the microscope and the space shuttle, and these inventions were created through a few people coming up with one idea and then asking for more opinions and advice from others. Because these incredible scientists worked together, we have these inventions in today's world. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision or plan because more points of view will be provided and less mistakes will be made.

One reason why asking for advice is very useful is because it can provide different points of view. For instance, when a student is choosing electives for school they might ask their parents if they are making the right decisions. Children and adults have very different perspectives, so the student's parents would most likely give different ideas then the student had thought of. Although people sharing ideas from different perspectives can sometimes lead to disputes and arguments, most people asking for advice have open minds and are willing to listen to different thoughts. However, receiving multiple points of view isn't the only reason people should ask for advice.

Another reason people should ask for advice is because asking can help them identify mistakes. People often overlook important details while creating an idea or making a choice, but when they ask for advice the people they ask can help them identify their flaw. For example, when people are planning a party they might forget to choose the kind of cake they are going to buy. When they ask a peer for advice their peer can point out their mistake, or the person planning the party will talk through their plan with the individual they asked for advice from and realize their flaw. Many mistakes will be avoided by people seeking for advice.

In order to make the best decisions possible, mankind must learn to ask for advice from others. Asking for advice can help change the world in a positive way because the decisions people make will most likely have a good outcome for the community around them. Seeking advice before making choices and plans is very important because mistakes can be avoided and different opinions can be heard.      ",4,1617850000000.0,1360,1550,"However, receiving multiple points of view isn't the only reason people should ask for advice.

Have you ever wondered about the dangers of operating a phone while driving? Should people be able to use a phone while driving a car? Will there be a future of using phone while driving? There is a great percentage of drivers that use their phones while driving a car. With many opportunities to use a phone while stopped at a red light or stuck in traffic, phones have been a danger to many people. Not being able to use a phone while driving a car is true because of distractions and car crashes.

Using a phone while driving a car is very dangerous. Most car crashes are caused by drivers scrolling through social media, taking pictures, looking at navigation, or searching for music (Evans Moore). Edgar Snyder & Associates states that ""There are about 1.6 million car crashes a year just because the driver is using their phone."" Those car crashes that occurred are all because of drivers attempting to use their phones. Our smartphones are a great resource to have and use but are a major risk to our lives if used at a wrong time and place. Phones should be used before starting the car and used after getting to the desired destination. Drivers should not be able to use a phone while operating a car because they are a distraction and causes many car crashes.

In my personal opinion I don't think people should be able to use a cellphone while operating a car. There are many people lives at stake because of reckless drivers. ""According to the report, cell phones caused 26 percent of car accidents in the U.S. in 2014. Text messaging causes 5 percent of crashes (Bey & Associates)"". Using the phone makes the driver's main focus go from driving to what is on the screen. The reckless drivers cause car accidents and that can cause major injuries. Some of those injuries can cause permanent damage while others are small injuries.

I am pretty positive that there would be a future of using phones and driving. Even though there are many laws that say using a phone while operating a car isn't allowed people still do it on a daily. There are many states that have already banned the usage of phones while driving. ""18 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. All are primary enforcement laws-an officer may cite a driver for using a hand-held cell phone without any other traffic offense taking place (GHSA)."" There are always those who use their phone while driving, but they should be punished for their recklessness.

There would always be a danger to driving and using a phone. The drivers that look at their phones now are already a danger. With the next generation starting to drive there would be an even bigger percentage of accidents. Those who choose to use the phone while driving should suffer the consequences.

In my opinion, I think community service should defiantly be encouraged! However, I don't think it should be required. Many students may feel it is unnecessary to help out in there community, but after they perform one task of this act, I think they will take it into consideration that parks don't clean themselves, and elderly need friends too. I believe this one little action could change their perspective, and could slowly shape the world into a better place!

As some children may feel as if community service is a punishment, but I feel its a reward! You get to make many other people happy, and it doesn't cost anything but your time and effort. For example cleaning up a park puts a smile on every kid there, as well as their parents. ""Bingo!"" Another example is playing board games with the elderly! The youth of today might not understand that people in nursing homes may not get that much attention, or visitors, and they could get bored and lonely themselves. Even just volunteering to help out at the local soup kitchen would be a great help! Personally, putting a smile on someone's face is one of the greatest achievements one can get.

Elementary students should defiantly be aware of these situations and be able to volunteer. Although I personally hold an opinion that community service is the way to go, others may hold an opinion of their own. I suggest not forcing it upon the students to perform in this act, but encourage them to lend a helping hand as much as possible! Maybe you could reward them in some way, such as lunch with the teachers, or five extra minutes at recess every Friday. That may be hard for you to adjust, so if you could reason to give them extra credit for their actions, then I'm sure that will be enough to get a great community started!

Why are there only traditional, American, education in society today? We are going through a technological advancement period in the world, yet we have to force are selves to get ready just for school. Although, some people believe that attending classes online will have no real benefit, like, a classroom. I think that it is extremely beneficial to lots of students because students can learn on their own time, and they'll have less distractions overall.

I think all schools should have an option for online classes because it allows students to learn on there own time. They can sleep in and and get energized right before a busy day, which allows students to be able to process information faster and learn new material at a faster rate, than if they were in a classroom listening to some boring teacher, that they hate, teach the classroom. That's why students always fall asleep in there classes: Students, especially in high school, like to stay up late, so it helps them a lot to do what they want on there own time, instead of listening to a lecture about history that could take them 20 minutes to learn. Maybe they have jobs, and they work morning shifts, but school gets in the way of that.

Another reason why i think online classes should be an option is because students will be less distracted. When students are in the classroom, they can very loud and obnoxious. Some students like learning in a calm environment such as the library. Others, on the other hand, they love to just talk, talk, talk, which makes it harder for all the student who like a calm environment to think and be able to process the information the teacher is talking about. When their at home, they can do their work as best they can because theres no one to distract them. Imagine having slight hearing loss and students are being abundantly rude to the teacher; can't stop talking to there friends about some brand new Mercedes that just came out. The amount of participation your brain is engaging in is significantly reduced through out the class.

In conclustion, I think that it is extremely beneficial to lots of students because students can learn on their own time and have less distractions overall. Lots of students in schools feel left out because it's hard to learn without paying close attention to what the teacher is trying to teach you. Some people can't focus, others might have a learning disability. It's all about options, but lot's of students rather do online school then sit in a class.

But I'm going to give you reason why it good and bad. Some are good thing which could help out the driver driving it, but others that is going to be a problem for that person.

The good thing is that it would use only half of the fuel that a normal car would. And that the car is computerdriven meaning that is a smart car that would would self drive. And that the car well have alot of sensers that will be telling what to be doing.

And the bad thing about it is that the Google cars aren't truly driveless they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways. Or dealing with complicated traffic issues such as navigation through roadwork or accidents. And the problem is that it uses cameras to watch that the driver remain fouce on the road so while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver. So mainly how well it be sure that nothing is going to happen to the driver driving in the road.

They can steer accelerate and brake themself but it still needs of human skill to navigation through work zones and round accidents so mainly that the preson still have to be alert. Still even if traffic laws change new laws will need to oder to cover liability in case of an accident. Cause if the technology fails and someone is injured whos fault will it be the drivers or the manufacturers. Lets say that it was auto driving its self but somthing happens then there was an accident mainly it was the person that made the car not the drive he/she could had been paying atenchen to the road but dont know how to control the car from crashing. So mainly its the techology that had gone wrong.

So my thing is that it could be ok but when comes to technology failer all the problem goes to the manufacturer cause something had gone wrong. And the driver could had been doing all he/she did to do to not get in the accendent but could not prevent it form happing it the veitcal was still in control. So mainly that the car thing could and could not work well cause things could go wrong in unsupected ways that people would not reilizse it but things could go wrong and go out but some gravecanal brake out that could wipe everthing out. So I might go kinda against them if something goes wrong. ",3,1620970000000.0,138,313,"But I'm going to give you reason why it good and bad.

So its no wonder why people are really asking the question; "" are students better off taking online classes from home and/or video chatting with teachers"" In more than one way, No, there are plenty of valid reasons to why student should take online classes, but they dont stack up to why students are better off taking classes in regular public/privet schools.

To start it off, there are a lot of things socially about public schools that are very important for rising adults. Yes, you could say there are students that just want a chance to learn and dont care for the social aspect of school.

That may be true in some ways, but that is such a smaller percentage of people wanting be home schooled than those who dont. public school gives students a chance to build character and make possible life long friends. while being home schooled your stuck with whoever is at your house and whoever you know outside of your household when your not trying to get work done.

there is no argument that public schools are full of distractions. Especially with the technological advancement of phones. But the level of distractions at home are much higher than at public schools and thats while not trying to work. Think of how students around the work perform on there homework or whether they even do it. Now think of that but with the normal amount of school work. There is no denying there would be a decrease in performance if most students around the world were home schooled.

To give credit where credit is due. I can see why primarily home schooling most students is a good idea. It allows students to be in a possibly more comforting environment. students are able to work at there own pace, whatever that may be. But honesty there are so many more positives to public schooling, its hard to really make a argument between the two.

In conclusion, Its hard to take away from the advancements of technology seeing as home schooling is as possible as ever. there are just too many aspects of public schools that compensate for the easy laziness of of homeschooling. home schooling of course isnt all bad. there are some people that have not choice but to be home schooled for a wide range of reasons.

81720,2241006691,AE021F85F4D5,train,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There is no 'community service'

without 'community.' Think about that. Sure there's more to the community than just our school, but doesn't every little bit count?

There really are more important things to do than just sit around watching TV all day. What about all those children? Not the ones with all the new clothes, or the ones with the huge allowance. I mean the ones with nothing. The ones in which the only meal they eat is at school because a classmate offers them a little something. Those are the ones that need OUR help. They're not just in Haiti or Africa. They're right here in this very town, some even in this school.

Community service is simple. It can just be organizing a canned food drive and having each kid bring a little something in. We don't need to go all out. They say a little goes a long way. We all put in a little bit and before you know, we'll have enough to feed a nation. Or maybe just the kids in our town, but still, you get my point.

Community service should be necessary. There's nothing wrong with it.

You give a little time, get a little joy. It's a win win situation for everyone. Let's go out there and do something.

Lending a hand is all it takes. Just help the other students to understand that. We don't have to go and build a whole school in Africa, we just need to do SOMETHING. That something could simply be picking up litter or maybe helping a neighbor with some yard work. We just need to get involved.

All I ask that you think this over with an open mind. Sure kids have homework that they say they need to get done, but they don't do it either way. Let's get them off their couches and into the community. Maybe a field trip to see first hand what goes on? That could give the kids a wake up call. Just put yourself in the shoes of the needy.

On the other hand , some will disagree by saying that if students dont attend actual school they will become lazy and irresponsible. Distance learning will benefit many student and also school.

Distance learning will benefit students in many ways such as better attendance . If students are allowed to attend school while at home it will give them less chances of not attending. Something that students hate most is waking up in the morning to get ready for school. Having to wake up so early in the morning just to attend school for about eight hours will cause a student to become lazy and tired.

Unfortunately some student are born or are diagnosed a certain disability to where they cant attend school . However those students with disabilities have a right to have an education. Distance learning will really benefit those students by allowing them to attend school from home. There are many reasons why students benefit from distance learning but being able to help a child with a disability on their education is the most important reason.

If students dont attend their actual school there will be less problems. Some students are treated really bad in school , many are bullied , and also many like to be drama queens . However if students attend school at home it will benefit a child because they wont have to see other students and there will be less drama and more education. Schools will stop having so many bullying problems.

In Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog , "" After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because that we use cars too much, we are creating pollution that is basically driving the planet we live on downhill. There is a way to change this. Limiting car usage, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

Life can go on without cars. In VAUBAN,Germany a community has created a car-free city. The streets are completely car free. This is an experimental new district that is seeing if excluding cars can life become better not only physically but also mentally. Many people driving on the roads daily tend to have more stress from overcrowding streets, noise, and most of all crashes. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move to here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much pappier this way,"" said heidrun Walter."" (Source 1,3) From this evidence it shows that life without a car can actually have a better impact on a person.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is it reduces pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear smog from the global city after a near record pollution. From this ban alomst 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impunded due to their reactions from the fines. But these fines and bans came out with a positive effect in the end. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after a few days of putting the ban into effect. The smog cleared enough for the French ruling party to rescind the ban for certain days.

Has America's love for cars already started cooling? Or has technology taken the reason why we should drive away? Elisabeth Rosenthal states that , "" the interent makes telecommuting possibole and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. the renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the riswe in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (source 4, 35) I believe that since technology has evolved that people dont feel the need to leave home to meet friends when they can just use apps or call,text,facetime,etc.

I had the chance to see the Acropolis in Greece. Another thing I got to do was take a gondola ride in Venice. That was so beautiful and amazing! I've seen and done many other things such as a tour through the excavated castle in Grete; also the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are so many places to go; plus you get to help people on the way.

Besides, going many different places and seeing lots of extordinary artifacts you get to help people on the way. It was so fun meeting new people and getting to be a part that changes their life.

So you ask your friends and they help you with all of their ideas. When trying to make a big decision it is better to ask more then one person. asking more people is helpful because it helps you make better choices,it gives you people different ideas or opinions,and it gives you the best choice or decision.

Asking more people gives you better choices. while your making a big life choice you don't want people to give you bad ideas so when you ask multiple people there will be ideas that are good and can help you. My sister is trying to decide on what college she wants to go to while she was looking she would ask people what college do they think is best for her and someone said a college that she really liked and she found the right college. When it comes to a choice yo need the best feedback, so when your asking you ask more people because it is better feedback on the choice your going to make. I was trying to make a choice on what to do this weekend so I asked my family and they helped me come up with something fun to do this weekend. Making a good choice is hard without any help or feedback but when you work with others to make a choice it is much easier and very helpful. When you are born people start to think of names for you and its hard sometimes so they all come together and help your parents out to come up with the name you have today. Having help with your choices is better then by yourself because it makes for better decisions and choices.

Give you different ideas or opinions. Coming up with an idea can be difficult without other peoples help and ideas with different ideas it can help you in many different situations. I was doing a project and i needed some help because it was hard to do alone without other peoples opinions which I needed to do the project so when my brother helped me out I go to get his side or opinion on how my project should be done. Different peoples choices or opinions is very helpful in the society we have now because if we listen just to one person it will put an image in our heads and it wont help us down. When I was talking to my mom about what I thought about the society we are in I said somethings and my mom gave me her different opinion on what I said and it opened my eyes and gave me a new and different opinion. When it comes to ideas and opinions it helps to have more then one because having more then one can help you in many ways in your life.

Different ideas and opinions is all your gonna see in life and learning how to use and see them is very helpful in your future.

Gives a new perspective. Perspective has to do a lot with getting ideas or opinions and when you get a different perspective on something it is very helpful and can open your eyes to something new and different. I was at an event with my family and we listed to different people speak and we got a lot of different opinions and different perspectives on thing and it was a very good learning experience. When trying to get a new perspective on something it takes more then one person it takes multiple people to get a good perspective on something important. I had to do an interview on one of my teachers and I asked her what she thinks about our president and she gave me a whole new perspective on how politics work and how I should look at it. Ideas dont just come from you it comes from the things you see or the people you talk to and what you have experienced in your day to day life in those experiences you have learned and have seen different perspective. When I went to Generic_City I saw a lot of different things like how diverse it is over there like how people express themselves and how there are so many different perspectives on the world we live in now,politics,and all sorts of things that are really eye opening. Learning about perspective is very important in your life right now and when you learn about it it will help you become successful.

Under the electoral college system they vote for a slate of electors,who elect the president. I feel like that is a long chain of people, and it really doesnt need to be there. I dont understand why the popular vote that a candidate gets doesnt make them president.

Thats like if you were in a school talent show and got the popular vote from your peers but the teachers they vote for the other person and they ended up winning when theres clearly more peers then teachers. Isnt that kind of unfair? Do you see it know?

141067,AAAXMP138200001384032125_OR,2FA2ABCDD456,train,"Growing up as a kid, you had all your friends that you would hang out with everyday and always have a smile on your face, don't change that now. School can be stressful at times and when it was, you would make plans to go out with friends or just spill your thoughts to them, sometimes you just need a break. There is no reason to isolate yourself from the world, you will not benefit from that. always live your life to the fullest. The idea that students can benefit from taking classes at home is invalid because students need a social life, friends are always useful when you need them and another reason is that being home schooled can promote laziness, with no clubs or sports in your presence, students will have no interest in anything and lose motivation to do anything after they're done with their classes.

Having a social life can help you in many ways, why get rid of that? When taking classes at home, who are you gonna talk to? Once you're done with your classes, you'll be alone with no one to socialize with. Socializing is probably one of the most important things for teenagers. Having a social life will help your mental state and give you something to think about that isn't school. Having a friend can help you have someone to talk to when you need to, everyone has their bad days and you just need to let it all out, not everyone is comfortable with their family so having a friend can be very useful. Also learning with friends or even people just around you can help you learn better, you won't just be hearing yourself but you will also hear other people's thoughts which can help you gather more information and create more ideas. Lastly socializing can help students grow their character, you won't be able to grow without people being there for you and helping you.

Being home schooled can promote laziness which can affect students in many ways. If you're home schooled, what are you gonna do after you are done? There are no clubs or any activities for you to join, with nothing to catch your interest, you are more likely to end up staying home and do nothing that involves physical activity. With nothing to do, you will end up being lazy to do anything. If students are not active then their health will end up bad and could possibly start some bad habits. Students are too young to be facing any health and mental issues. Students need to be active everyday and taking classes at home does not help with that and can start them to be extremely lazy.

There are some people that claim that being home schooled can be beneficial. A reason why taking classes at home can be beneficial is because there won't be any distractions, so that means that students will mainly just be focused on their work which will help them maintain high grades which helps the student feel accomplished. Another reason is that students don't have to worry about what to wear, students don't have to fear about getting bullied for what they wear or what they look like and bullying can harm students really bad at the point where they can develop depression.

In conclusion the idea that students can benefit from taking classes at home is invalid because students need a social life and taking classes at home can promote laziness. There is no need to stay home and learn from home all by yourself, you can't learn a lot by yourself and you also can""t develop as a person.

This is why, when making important decisions, one tends to seek multiple opinions from others. Seeking multiple opinions help make a better choice because one can look in a different perspective and can consider the best options.

Looking in a different perspective can help people make better choices for themselves. Specifically, this is because having a new perspective can provoke more options for people to choose from. Seeking more advice from people with different thoughts can lead to more choices that one can consider. This is helpful because there is a bigger chance to have ideas that would make better decisions than the other. Also, one can consider things in a new way that they haven't thought about. If people are stuck with the one point of perspective that they have, this would not lead to another way of thinking. However, listening to other people for advice may help people to consider things in a way that they have not yet thought about. Therefore, the new way of thinking can turn things around into an opposite route of the original. Another example is that someone can propose an option that is better than you. Never think that you have the best idea, because there is always another creative mind that can think in a different perspective. One should get advice from these type of people, but continue to seek other opinions that may be better than the last. It is always useful to ask multiple people for advice because everyone has a different perspective that they look through.

Other people's opinion can be the key to deciding on the best option. First, it is important to ask people for advice because one can get multiple useful suggestions. If you have a handful of ideas in your mind, then you can ask people for the best options and why they think that. This would help people to carefully consider the options with actual reasons that support their answer. Additionally, one can make improvements to their thoughts. By getting advice from people, one can figure out what they are lacking. By knowing what has to be revised, they can make improvements to their thinking. One would also be able to gain knowledge from people. It is possible that others know more information about the topic that is being considered. From gaining new information, this could also help figure out the options that would be better overall, when considering the new knowledge into the decision. When trying to find out the best option that is on the plate, it is helpful to ask others about their opinion.

Considering the best option and looking into things with a new perspective can help people make better decisions.

Receiving more advice is very useful, because one person could of been in the same situation your in and the other person could just know the right thing to do.

Time. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle.

If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents.

Over the past few years, cell phones have been upgrading thanks to the use of modern technology. Phones are like everyone necessity in living. Humans have the tendency to use their phones wherever they go, like making a call in the bathroom or checking their social media during a meeting or texting while driving the most well-known situation. Seems these devices always get the best of us making it a priority for us to check it because everyone seems to depend on them. Using cell phones while driving to text, place phone calls, or hand free-devices should be forbidden for the safety and protection of everyone on the road. Here are some causes as to why it is unacceptable to use a phone while driving.

Texting while driving has remained a tremendous influence on teenagers and young adults because of the use of technology has impacted this era strongly. When people hear their notification going off it triggers them to check their phone immediately on the spot. This causes accidents to occur because humans are too negligent to abide by the rule. If people can merely follow the law of the road and not examine their messages or attempt to respond until they make it to their destination with no accident occurring the rate of people dying in a car accident will reduce.

People believe that making phone calls is safer than texting. Well think again, people tend to get way into their conversation on the cellular phone that they don't concentrate on what doing causing things to go up in flames. For instance, cooking a meal for the family but suddenly receiving a call from a relative becoming too caught up after a long time, an hour pass the food starts to burn all because of a phone call imagine that happening on the road. But certain circumstances it can be understandable. For example, say that a loved one called for something that may be urgent or cannot be postponed then safely stop somewhere off the road to get out of harm way and answer it. These moments can be crucial to the life of another. So just wait for an appropriate time to use the cellular device.

Nevertheless, hands-free devices. These machines allow people to talk on the phone while maintaining control over the vehicle, however, it can still be risky. Inquiries have shown that chatting with someone on the telephone forces the cerebellum into using most of its strength into the conversation. This indicates that a limited amount of the brain's focus is direct attention on operating the car. This could also determine a discussion with someone in the vehicle is highly threatening, so if this were to be combined with a poor response, it must be cope with an awkward hands-free earpiece to wear which can be inconvenience due to the static or wind, its just a serious disturbance.

To sum up, phones and driving don't go well together. For it has caused too much unfortunate accidents and damage for us and can do more in the future. If the situation can't wait, you can always stop and look for a place to park so you can return the call or text. As for hands-free devices, they can be useful but just wait for the appropriate time to handle it, for it can be inconvenient at the time. Smartphones use should be taken to consideration for people have been abusing the use of this for too long. It may be as inaccessible, but if taken into thought the lives that would be saved this is a worthy sacrifice. There won't be a loss of nearly as numerous juvenile lives to talk or texts if they know their permission could be taken if they chose to continue this act.

Most planetary scienist have all thought about what it would take to send a human up into outer space and set for on one of the roughest terrains in all of the solar system. The author of, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", knows that though exploring the dangerous planet is astronomical to think about, more people should start learning that it's a worthy pursuit. The author thinks it's worthy, because Venus is very similar to Earth is many different ways, it's the planet closes to us, the rough conditions are just small roadblocks in the eyes of an infinite space, and he also says that if people can't make it to a planet so close to Earth there's no hope to explore any of the other planets. The author supports his idea well, because of how many alternative solutions he has to the problems he's faced with.

Firstly, he starts out with the statement that Earth and Venus are some of the two most similar planets. They're similar because of the shape and size, which line up nearly perfectly with Earth's. The density is close together, and it has similar face and structural features, like moutains and revenes. The artical states that, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The similarity between these two neighboring planets makes it all the more worthwhile to see when NASA finally reveals what is there.

Secondly the author says that, though the conditions are more difficult than anything they've ever experienced before, scientists are making new and improved machinery every day. So far, no shuttle has been able to stay on the planet for too long, but the sooner there's advancements made towards putting more things on Venus, the better off they will be. The newer technology tends to be more fragile with it's highly advanced computer parts, ut if the new doesn' work there's always a chance to go back to the old. Matic computers would work better in harsh conditions than a MacBook Pro, which requires charging and optimal temperatures. The article says that, ""...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos on Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."" Bringing back or creating new ideas is the key to getting near, or on, the destructive planet without losing lives or money.

Finally, the author takes into thorough consideration that the temperatures and brutal lack of livable substance on the planet, but he realizes that it's more important that we find a way to observe and explore it. If science can't find a way to make it to Venus, the close, neighboring, sister planet, it may be impossible for them to make it to any other place in the galaxy.

It would maybe be a great technology but most people wouldnt be confortable doing or not doing something they havent did all their lifes.

28876,AAAXMP138200001029592144_OR,F32A2BA3BEC6,train,"When students first get out of school, the last thing they're thinking about is a summer project. Let alone an extremely difficult one designed by a teacher. Summer projects should be designed by students who've previously taken the class because it lifts a lot of weight off of the teachers' and students' shoulders, it will be a more effective learning process, and it can also make sure the students who previously took the class learned something.

If students designed summer projects it will be less work for the teachers and students. The teacher won't have to worry about how many questions it should be, what method is most effective, and just deal with all the stress it will bring in general. Teachers' jobs are already hard and stressful enough, they deserve a break and easier life just as much as we do. Although some may say it's apart of their job, teachers still deserve a little less work, especially if the work can easily be taken off of them. If students designed the summer projects it will ease the the minds of the students receiving those projects as well. Students who are making the projects already know how much stress can be endured while in school and taking hard classes, so they won't necessarily make the project easier but more manageable.

Students understand each other more than any teacher would. This is an advantage because students know how students learn and how much work is too much work. Since students know how other students learn, they can make the project a true learning experience. Most students who receive summer projects now will simply share the answers with their friends or search for them online. If students were to make the project, they know how to avoid these things and how to make it so that the students receiving the project can't cheat. Teachers may already know that other students cheat or share answers but there is not much they can do about it. Teachers also usually use the same summer project every year for quite some time. If students make them they will change every year, due to the fact that there are new students every year. Students also know when there is too much work and when there isn't enough. Teachers tend to overload because they feel students have the whole summer to work on this so all the work shouldn't be a problem. Realistically, no student is going to do homework everyday of their vacation and previous students understand that. With that being said, previous students will know how lengthy they should make this project and what to ask for from the students to test their knowledge but not overload them in work.

In conclusion, students should make summer projects because they understand better and can relate to other students better, they know what to expect from them, and it helps the teachers a lot. Students will ultimately learn better this way and won't be tempted to cheat because they wouldn't need to. Everyone benefits from having he students make the summer projects. Teachers have less work, students receiving the projects will learn enough while not stressing, and students making the summer project will test their knowledge and prove they learned while taking the class.

Today, the majority of people own and operate cell phones and many of those people also drive on a daily basis. Drivers should keep their attention on the road to minimize distractions and avoid car accidents. With that being said, we know that cell phones have become very distracting because it occupies one's eye and takes their attention when what they should be focused on the road. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. This is not only causing a distraction for the driver but also endangering the lives of others around them at the same time. (5)

As a teenager, most of us feel that one of the best things we can ever do is get our driver's license. At the time all we're thinking about is ""Yes, I can finally drive."" We instantly get on our electronic devices and start taking pictures and sharing on social media so the whole world knows what we just accomplished. It hardly ever crosses our mind that in order to maintain having our driving privileges and showing our parents that we really can be responsible when they're not around, we need to remain focused on the road at all times. As I was doing my research, I came across a lawyer's website that said teen drivers are 4 times more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes when talking or texting on a cell phone. This was very alarming to me but I can easily see how that's possible. I feel strongly about this because anything you need to do on your electronic device, you can do before the vehicle starts. (7)

We know that people who drive and text are more likely to cause accidents that can hurt and or even kill other people. If you feel like it is that important to make a phone call or send a text, the best thing you can do is pull over to the side of the road and take care of it. The other option would be to link your phone to your car so that you can practice the hands-free options. This will include allowing you the ability to stream music, answer phone calls, asking for directions, and etc. You will also find that most cars have voice activated calling and some can even read your text messages through the car. All these are options are not the answer to the solution but they will give you a better chance to be a safer and more focused driver without having to take your eyes off the road. (6)

Modern cars are being built to be able to stop before any accident occurs. People shouldn't depend on their cars to stop because the functions can fail at any given time. Drivers need to be prepared on their own, when you took their driver's test you didn't have that option. If the safety feature works most of the times, it can help keep all drivers safe on the road. (4)

Being a part of the generation we are in allows us more opportunities because of our advanced technology. But this it is not always a good thing. Some phone companies can detect when a car isn't moving and will automatically send calls to voicemail or send text messages to let others know that person is unavailable at the moment. Cell phones should not in any way be utilized while driving because it's one of the easiest ways to jeopardizes one's life and their well-being. I think that technology will keep us safer but making good decisions will keep us safer. (4)

I really think that it isn't fair that you are planning on canceling school sports and other activities just because of our grades being a ""C"" average. A c for a grade is actually good because its better then a D or F.I think that you should just give the students a chance to bump up their grades. Really what i feel is that you shouldn't even consider in canceling the school sports or activities because everyone isn't just the smartest person in the world. Some people just don't understand the procedures they are told to do in class. Did you every think that maybe it's your teachers who aren't teaching them correctly? Maybe their teachers aren't motivating them. Out of all the in this school you want to ruin why ruin sports and activities? Some students actually like coming to school because they have the time to practice for sports, and play in games, and be on teams. And as of the activities: It is a state law that all students MUST TAKE ART AND MUSIC. Those are activities. Activities that you can't take away.

what about dance class, Spanish, and PE? Dance is the type of class us students can just have fun in for about 30-50 minutes. It gets the work stress off of our brains.. And PE is a class where you can do nothing but play sports, games, and other fun activities for about 40minutes. And lets not forget Spanish...

Some children want to learn a different language. Knowing a different language would be good on a college application for a job hire.

144370,AAAXMP138200000989102125_OR,209EE46FB0BB,train,"Over time, traditional schooling has evolved drastically. The standard one room school houses that were once prevalent in the 1900's, have now turned into massive buildings, often having more than one floor and schooling up to 1,000 students a year. Due to the many ways education has evolved, it is important to be able to accommodate the needs of various students. With new advancements in technology, many options are now available for students who are unable attend school due to their circumstances. Programs such as Google Classroom and Vision make online learning easier and accessible for both students and teachers. All schools should offer some form of distance learning because of the benefits of ease of access, self paced learning, and learning how to become independent.

Famous teenagers are known to benefit significantly from distance learning. Many of these teenagers are often traveling to different countries and various events, so traditional school timings are not acquirable. Due to the introduction of using technology to learn from home, famous teenagers as well as other students no all have access to an education no matter where they are. The same goes for students who live in completely rural farming towns with schools that require most a 30 minute commute. Depending on where a person might live, the school closest to them can be as far as 10 miles away or more. These students are able to benefit from taking classes at home because they are more easily accessible, in turn enticing the students to attend online conferences and finish school. The major benefits of this would be the students having access to learn from the comfort of their homes despite any hardships that deter them from attending school.

Learning from home also allows a student to learn at their own pace. In traditional school setting theres a 90 minute interval of learning subject and then switching classes to learn subject. This limits a student from being able to spend time in class to learn material. Having classes that a student could attend form home would allow the students to keep their classes self paced . Say that a student is feeling bombarded with work after having 4 classes within 8 hours a day in a traditional school setting. Offering classes through distance learning would allow the student to decide when to take which class as well as how much time to spend on the subject. Without allotted times and restrictions just like traditional school offers, the amount of time spent on learning material will help the students encode the information and retain it more easily and effectively. Attending classes at home also allows the student to adjust their schedules accordingly. Whereas most high schoolers go to school from 9:15am -4:03pm, and then arrive to their jobs at 5 pm, working late into the evening, having classes at home can eliminate having less time do homework, sleep, and extracurricular. A student who is taking classes at home might prefer to go to work early in the morning and start their classes around 3 pm and spend more time on a certain subject. Allowing students to attend classes from home gives them the ability to chose their own work paces as well as accommodate to their own learning styles.

Students learning from classes online and at their own paces would be benefit greatly by learning how to become independent and self efficient. The traditional school setting motivates you to get assignments turned in due to deadlines and learn due to emphasis from teachers and their peers. Taking classes from home can either cause a student to become extremely disorganized and lazy, or learn how to effective rely on themselves to manage time wisely and get tasks done like mature young adult. Allowing for students to take part in learning from home through online classes will keep them in charge and accountable for their education. It will also work to prepare them for the next phase in life, college. Since more academic freedom is given in college, learning how to balance time wisely through taking classes at home, will help better prepare students for the future. Distance learning will prompt students to come up with schedules catered to their needs and wants in order to work towards earning good grades and accomplishing tasks.

There are numerous benefits to introducing distance learning for students in traditional schools. Being able to take classes at home willl allow many schools to accomodate to the various needs of their students. Many students will be able to enhance their learning through working on course material at home and becoming more independent in their lives. Students will also be able to take classes wherever and whenever needed, encouraging all students to finish school. Thanks to the advancements in technology and teaching methods, having classes accessible at home on and off campus allow for students to easily participate in school, learn how to take control of their learning, and prepare for the future. ",5,1621950000000.0,746,782,"learning how to become independent.

Online school is used to help students make up classes that they failed or didn't take during the school year. Some students even want to graduate early which means students are interested in online classes. Others might want to free some spaces for another class. A majority percentage of students even think its easier to do online school than public school.

One benefit of online school is students can finish any of the modules or lesson given early or late and still receive a good grade. Online students should be given a long period of time to finish assignments and projects because students can spend time thinking or researching about the assignment that was assigned.

Students in public schools are given less than a week to finish assignments which case stress and anxiety. Students are afraid that their projects or assignment is not good enough because of the short completion period. Public school students are given one class to do a entire lesson which is not a lot of time to be taught about a certain topic. Online school students can finish the lesson at a their pace which can reduce stress. Researchers found it shocking that students that attend online school tend to have a better grade than public school students because of the time given to students.

Second benefit of online school is it should be allowed for students to advances in core classes and electives. Students should also be given to opportunity to retake a class over the summer.

Why is taking a class better in the summer than during the school year? Classes tend to be less stressful during the summer than online classes during the school year because of summer break. Class during the school years are more stressful because sharing a online class with classes at school tends to build up stress which is not good for mentality. Students retaking a class over the summer is a good thing because it helps them relearn the main material that was learned from previous classes. It should also help the student know what they did wrong in the past and help them pass the class. This is a good thing because students can use the material they learned online and use it in the future.

Third benefit of online school is students can access the class anytime anywhere and you can ask for help easily. This is very beneficial because students can easily access the class with a click of a button. Students can access the class if they have extra time to spare, coming back from a sports event , and a important meeting for a club. It could also be accessed during vacation break when you're in a car ride to a water park or Disneyland and you want to get some assignments done before the fun. Students can also seek help by taking advantage of the video conferencing system. Students are on the video chat to interact with the teacher and the lesson so its easier to type a question. Students can also email the teacher of the class and ask for help or a question.

Some might say that public school is a better option for education but that saying is not true because online school has proven to many parents and students that it is a less stress zone and more beneficial to students. Students have a lot of time to finish assignments online. They can spend time at home with the parents while they do school work. Public school has nothing but offered stress and anxiety to many students.          ",5,1620930000000.0,3093,3245,but that saying is not true because online school has proven to many parents and students that it is a less stress zone and more beneficial to students. ,Rebuttal,Rebuttal 1,Adequate,1620930000000.0,Some might say that public school is a better option for education ,Counterclaim,Virginia,Independent,,Distance learning,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

9119,5076890,027616F7ED1D,train,"Cars are a big influence in our worlds society, everyone wants to be able to drive and many people do drive. But as good as driving seems there are also many negative things that occur when driving a car. But the affects of limited driving can potentially have a positive impact on our lives and our enviorment.

In our world a large number of people drive cars to get to work, school and many other places. Due to people driving, there have been serveral negative effects to our planet. Due to people driving from place to place there are very high polution levels in our atmosphere, from the exhuast that the car lives off. For example, in Europe cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions and in the United States it is fifty percent of green house gas emissions. This can potentially damage our enviorment and hurt our planet. But not all of this has to be negative. Many countries have been setting up days or even banding cars in general to decrease levels or pollution and promot limited car use is a positive thing. This is an attempt to help clean up our enviorment. On the positive side if we were to stop using passenger cars for transporation our enviorment would be alot cleaner more suitable to live in. If we stop driving and even owning cars it could potentially have an impact on our personal lifes and make us more relaxed and feel happier. For example a women by the name of Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Many countries are currently making a serious effort to stop the use of cars in all. Some countries have completely wiped out the usage of cars and have gone to riding bikes, walking, and even taking the bus. These efforts can only have a positive effect on our enviorment. If every country tries to enforce the fact that cars are damaging our enviorment then potentially the pollution levels and the smog levels will begin to decrease and maybe even depleat.

Passenger cars in the world is a bigger issue then everyone thinks. But if everyone pitches in to the idea that no cars equals a better society then I believe that Passenger cars will soon be gone for good. Passanger cars in the world are coming to an end and our enviorment is going to be healthier than ever.                         ",3,1622120000000.0,205,208,But ,Unannotated,Unannotated 1,,,,,Florida,Text dependent,"Source 1: ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal

107940,5158315,4CA37D113612,train,"Have you ever wondered what the electoral college is? If you answered no I would say me to, but in this essay im going to explain why i am for it. I havent heard of the electoral college till now. So sit back and read this.

I think that we should do the electoral college, so everyone has a say on who they want to be the state senate. Under the college system,  voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. While others might say no we need to get rid of the electoral college, because the senate might be bribing the voters, so he knows that he/she has their vote for sure.

This is where it gets tricky. Alot of people might disagree with you because you have a different point of view than them, but it is ok if you disagree with them, because its your vote that counts. This might be what they say ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". The biggest arguments are, because people say that one of the runners in the campaign did something they wasn't suppose to do.

At the most basic level, The elctoral college is unfair to voters. That is probaly something you would say if you was against the electoral college. It's ok to go for what you believe in. You might get judged but who cares it's your opinion don't listen to them.

I personally think that we should keep it. The Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. It's the electors that elect the president not the people. When your voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. it's nearly impossible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Believe it or not its has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that's the first time since 1988.

There is 5 reasons for retaining the electoral college despute its lack of democratic pedigree. It may have ripped some people off, but at least we got people as good presidents. You may not like them, but they have helped us over the years that we were in debt and need. Like right now the president's wife is helping the obese kids at school by putting in whole grains and healthier foods. Those are good reasons, but not as good as these.

Certainty of out come.

The reason is that winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds more than enough. Because almost all the states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis, even a vey slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible. But the stakes are highly unlikely to happen.

Everyone's President

The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. There is region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president. some people has no incentive to campaign heavily in the states that they are regionally favorited, becuse they will not gain any electoral votes by increasing their plurality.

Swing States

The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in the toss up states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign. So they know that they are going to know that they are deciding the election. They are also likely to be the most thoughtful voters.

Big States

The elctoral college restores somke of the weight in the political balance that large sates lose by virtue of the mal-appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The most popular vote in 2012 was by the state of Florida. Obama won that election with only 29 electoral votes. Bigger states get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state does.

Avoid Run Off Elections

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which the candidate recieves a majority of the votes by the cast. When neither of the candidates recieve majority vote it becomes more intense, because they start trying their hardest so they can win the election. Well there is the five reasons.

It can be argued but only one will be victorious. Will we keep the electoral vote? Or will we get rid of it? So if i persuaded you to keep it pick, then keep if i didnt, then pick get rid of it. Which one will you choose.    ",3,1614800000000.0,2078,2174,"

Advice is a great key to many things, so you want to get good advice. if getting that means asking many people, than so be it. Advice will help you all throughout life, through problems, good or bad. And don't foget that someones advice isn't ever the best way to go. You want to get more than one person's opinion so you know which ways seem to work.

There are some great reasons for getting more than one person's opinion. First off, you want to make sure the advice someone tells you is common. Most of the time if advice isn't common, it usually means people don't like that way, or there's a better way. Another reason for getting more opinions is you should always ask how different ideas worked out for people. You might have heard someone did good with an idea, but someone else could've done better with something else. Lastly, you should ask different people because you might find ways that interest you. Sometimes people like ideas that don't interest you, so you have to find a way you like that's a strong enough idea.

There are many examples of getting more than one opinion when getting advice. A very important situation, is figuring out what type of college you want to go to. Some people might say, go to a community college for a couple of years or this college is really a great one. Another example is figuring out a sport you want to play. Obviously you should pick a sport that interests you, but you can always ask people what sports they've enjoyed. For a final example, helping the environment.

To begin, many cities have already set limitations on automobile usage such as Vauban, Germany and the outskirts of Freiburg near the Swiss and French boarders. Freiburg has actually banned cars except for the main thouroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community.

70 percent of people in Vauban do not have a vehicle and 57 percent sold their car to move to Vauban. As we all know cars take a toll an the atmosphere itself by adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in the United states are emited through cars, but on the other hand cars are responsible for only 12 percent. It seems to be that the car-less cities tend to be declining the negative effects in the atmosphere.

Next, Paris took the no-car rule to another level by banning all cars, depending on the day, to reduce conditions in the air quality because of the emitiones from the vehicles. A thick smof loomed over the city because of the gases produced form the automobiles. Drivers with licence plates with even numbers would not use their cars for the day and odd cars would be off the next in an attempt to redice the smog. After numerous days of reduced cars the smog began clear from it's usual state.

Also, another city that's cutting down car usage is Bogota Colombia. Bogota has created a ""car-free"" day to reduce the harmful gases created by cars and to encourage alternative forms of transportation. Anyone driving a vehicle would be fined $25. The turnout was big with many people participating showing reat results on the atmospheric conditions above the city. Another great thing that came out of this is the enthusiasm it brought to other countries who wanted some thing like this to encourage other formes of transportation and reduce pollution.

As seen in the article, limiting the time we use cars has a great impact on the environment and people around you. So what do you say? Put down the keys and ride a bike today!

They make sure you keep learning through the summer, so you can be prepared for what's to come next school year. So, without proper guidance, the summer projects would mostly be unhelpful. Therefore, I think summer projects should be teacher-designed, because a student-designed summer project would be too easy and unhelpful, and a teacher-designed project would be more productive and helpful going into the next school year.

Students undergo a lot of stress as the school year goes along, and summer is supposed to be our break from all of that stress. So, a summer project is the last thing we want to do during our relaxing break from school. So, if you gave us control over the summer project, we'd make it very simple and easy on ourselves. For example, my friend, Generic_Name had control over his summer project for his English class. He didn't want to do much, so he told the class to just read a page from any type of media, and write a paragraph summarizing what you read. For some students, that's difficult, but he knew that wasn't hard at all compared to what his teacher as going to assign. He chose to assign something that was quick and easy, so that he could enjoy his summer without any stress, but that caused him and his classmates to have a rough time in English class the following year.

Teachers go to school for four years, or more, so they can get the right information and resources to properly teach a class, and that's not easy to do. So, teachers truly know what's right for their students, although to us students, it may not seem like they do. Also, a helpful summer project is not easy to plan. Therefore, I believe that we should trust their judgment and do their projects, because it'll definitely prove to benefit us for the upcoming school year. For example, Ms. Generic_Name, my English teacher, kept insisting on us reading a book over the summer, and writing a book report on it. I hated the summer project at first, but she gave us an amazing book to read, and the book report came out to be one of the best, I've ever done, because it was over the summer, so that was the only thing I had to worry about for the whole break.

Some people think that students should have control over their summer projects, because they know what works for them, and their summer shouldn't be spent stressing over a project. That does make sense, but I think teachers will understand that it's summer break, so they won't assign you something overly complicated, but they will challenge your brain, so you can keep using the skills you learned throughout the year to prepare you for next school year.

In conclusion, teacher-designed summer projects, would be more helpful for students, because most students wouldn't make their projects challenging, so they can relax their whole summer, and all of our teachers know how it feels to be a student, so they won't give us something extremely challenging, but they will give us something challenging enough for us to be prepared for what next year has to come.",5,1618690000000.0,2710,3100,"teacher-designed summer projects, would be more helpful for students, because most students wouldn't make their projects challenging, so they can relax their whole summer, and all of our teachers know how it feels to be a student, so they won't give us something extremely challenging, but they will give us something challenging enough for us to be prepared for what next year has to come.

There are a variety of activities that can keep you busy and help you learn a few life skills. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because, they can learn to cooperate with others, be interested in something they didn't know about, and improve their social skills.

Extracurricular activities can help students learn to cooperate with one another. When on a team, teammates work together to achieve good results. In my opinion, it is easier to get good results when you work with others. Cooperation can also help us be better decision makers. When you work with others, you have the ability to discuss your thoughts to make a final decision. Cooperation is a good life skill to have for the future. You might work with co-workers, or you might have to cooperate with customers. Overall, cooperation is important in many ways and extracurricular activities can help you gain that life skill.

There are many benefits to trying new things. With the amount of things you can try, you can form hobbies that can keep you busy. Hobbies can unlock talents you never knew you had and can also bring up self confidence. You are likely to meet new people with similar likes and dislikes. Making new relationships can make extracurricular activities more enjoyable. If you continue doing a certain activity, you can most likely find a job that involves a form of that activity. Knowing what you enjoy doing, you can make future decisions easier such as, what collages you want to apply for. In conclusion, trying new things can make you do your best and expand your interests.

However, some may say extracurricular activities are a waste of time and money. Some activities might require fees and time after school. But it is not a waste of time and money because, you can improve many life skills such as, social skills. Some people might be shy and not very social, but when you meet others who have been in your situation, you can open up and discuss your opinions. Being social is a big part of team work because you need to communicate and agree.

Students should be involved in extracurricular activities because, they can learn to work with others, try new things, and be more socially active. Extracurricular activities can benefit students in many ways.

Nobody should be forced or be expected to do something that does not benefit them self. You can't always please everyone by doing something extra. If you spend all your time doing things for your school you will have no tome for yourself. Some people will come and some people will go off and do their own stuff so there really is not a point in doing that if people just dont show up.

However, some people will agree with doing an extra activity, some people will disagree because of the following reason, many teens play the ""mother"" or ""father"" role in the household. They provide the money by working after school and the cook and clean. If you add another activity when will they have the time to do any of that?

If you have aver cooked ant cleaned at the same time you will know how stressful it it and weather or not they like it. Just think about it, why would you add more stress to a teenagers life?

If any school in the world would make that a new rule I hope someone would stop it. I dont want to make it seem like its the worst thing in the world but I will say its probably not the best thing to add to a teens schedule. Maybe if it was a homework club that you could choose to go to and all of you teachers would be there to help you and help you get a better understanding on work and maybe your siblings could attend also to just get a taste of middle school or highschool is like. I think that schools should also offer something like a free block that students can visit other teachers during the school day.

In conclusion, I dont really agree with making kids do something outside of school. I would like to know the outcome if you dont participate in any out-of-school activities. It seems to cause too much trouble. If any school is considering on doing it maybe the the students advice and ask them if they think it is a good idea or take a vote.

If only he had chosen an easier topic for his summer project, and done it earlier. Although some believe otherwise students should be able to design their own project, because they will have the creativity factors that controlled projects would not, they can choose their own subject, and they have an increased growth in responsibility.

Us students love the creativity aspect of getting to choose how we get to work. We hate being bound to guidelines and rules set by other people. Whenever I get to choose how I do my projects I always seem to do better on them when I get to be more creative. A couple of months ago, my AP Environmental sciences teacher let us choose an end of year project. She said ""as long as you get it in on time, I do not care what or how you do it. The project just has to pertain towards some of the topics that we learn during the course."" I loved getting that freedom from her, because I got to do it how I wanted and I got to be more creative with it too. I ended turning in that project within a month, because it was something that I wanted to do. If I was bound to the rules I would have procrastinated until the night before it was due. Some may disagree, saying that they are more likely to do the project when guidelines are given and when students are forced not to be creative. That reasoning is flawed due to the fact that my friend Generic_Name was given a similar project, but with guidelines saying the stuff that she could and could not do. She has always been better than me at turning in assignments. When I found out that I had turned in my project before her ,I was astonished. I asked her why she had not not done yet. She said that she had not even figured out what she was going to do. She was bound to do what she was told to do and she lost the creativity factor that she has always loved. Creativity is vital to a students success when doing projects. It ensured that every project is different and more entertaining than traditional projects.

Getting to choose a subject also makes the project more enjoyable for the students. If students were given a choice to select a subject that they would do a summer project on, they would most likely choose the subject that they feel more confident in. My mother always says that she loved to do projects on history (which was her favorite subject when she was in high school). She said that whenever she would get to do a project on it she would get A's and B's every time, but she would get C's on other projects that was not on her favorite subject. This choice in subjects was a morale booster for her. When she got good grades she got more confident and when she got more confident she got better grades. The choice correlated with her mental health and her school life, because she always felt good about her work.

Some say that if we get assigned a subject then we will be more likely to do what the person who grades is looking for. That is not the case, because of my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name had to do a summer project last year and he had no idea what to do. He called me an asked what my project was on. I told him that me and just about everyone in our friend group was doing our project on History. When the school year started I asked him what he did it on, and he said his project was on Economics. When we got our grades back he had gotten the highest out of all of our friends. This just shows that it is more likely for someone to get a better grade when they get to choose a project subject or topic that they enjoy to do.

In our youthful society responsibility is a huge part of maturing. Getting to choose a project makes kids more responsible in the long run. This past weekend my parents left me home while they went to go watch my sister play lacrosse at Generic_School in Rhode Island. I stayed home with my dog and had a lot of time to myself and to my studies. I could have pushed it off until Sunday night, but I decided to do the responsible thing and do it during the day on Saturday. The choice I made was the right one, because I had the rest of the weekend to myself and got to relax and not stress about having to do my homework. If I can choose to be responsible now then I can be responsible when it comes to a summer project. I think that growth in responsibility will also have a great effect on everyone that does this project. The responsible person would choose to do the project earlier in the summer, but the kids that procrastinate will stress about this until the day before the project is due. Some think that responsibility has nothing to do with this project, that is not true. We are trusted to be responsible young men, women, or however people identify themselves. This project is not just about learning at school, but learning about life. When given the choice to do the project how we want to do it responsibility plays a huge factor. Factors like: Will we get it done on time, how will we do it, what topic will we do it on, and if the project actually had time spent on it or if it was just sped through. Us students need to be responsible in order to get in to good colleges, get good jobs, and live good lives. It all starts with projects like these. When all of these factors are put together they are more likely to make us more responsible in the long run.

When we get to choose what we do for projects like these it makes everyone feel good about what they are turning in. It could be the coffee in my system talking, but us students have responsibilities and we need to start being trusted and treated like adults. We want to be creative like adults, think like adults, and live like adults. It all starts with letting us choose a subject for our projects.

This wouldn't work because the first half of people who get the driverless car will be safer. But then the half that doesn't have the smart car will run to the smart car and we are still back to square one. As it says in the story ""sensors are nothing new."" Sensors are always going to fail there is no way to stop technolgy from failing on point in time. Everything is too new. When one of the parts need replaced on these smart cars its going to cost a fourtne to fix. You already see how with all the technolgy in our cars now its getting to expensive to fix. The problem is the flaw is that they are going to have to keep updating cars and maps in the cars so the car to know the fastest way to the destination. Also if there is unexpected road work it will be try to go right threw the road work and i dont see that working.

The next problem i invision is that all the laws will have to be changed to meet the critera of the car. This will in a way force the people who dont want to buy a smart car to have to buy one. As stated in paragraph 9 the car are not reliable enough for the laws to get changed.

This is not a safe idea at all because there will always be that one parent that who will program there car to do something for the child and they will expect the car to get to that destination safely. But the risk of a malfunction is very great. The parent doesn't see the risk until it is too late and the child is either hit by another motorist or the car malfunctions and the kid runs into something and the car has gotten wrecked. I also don't feel like it should be the manufacturers fault for the stupidity of the parent.

Another problem is that if a person wants to stop at some where or at a gas station for a snack or for a restroom break they can't. They can't because the car was only programed to go to that certain place. So in other words you would have to go to the destination then turn right around and go to the gas station or store.

As of right now i still think that humans are way more reliable than technolgy. I feel like there will always be accidents.

Only asking your friend might not give you the best answer to the question. But if you ask multiple people that are in the same field as you, they might answer your question the best. When there is a decision to be made, it is always important to ask more than one individual for advice because it helps you know all the possible solutions, avoid bias, and learn from others' past experiences. These different opinions will assist you in making the best choice.

Talking to different sources allows you to understand the different options fully. You need to understand every option by knowing the pros and cons before you make your decision. This helps you understand what your getting into depending on the options. I was asked to be on a basketball team that traveled around the country. I talked with my coach, parents, and family about the offer. Their opinions helped me learn the pros and cons of this opportunity. This allowed me to know what I was going to be doing if I accepted the offer. From their assistance I was able to make a choice that benefited me and my family.

If only one opinion is heard, your answer would lean toward their bias or your own. All people have a bias that is favored in some situations. It is human nature! These thoughts can be pushed aside though. The simple solution is asking multiple people for advice. It sounds easy, but most of the time, we still make the same mistake. We put our personal thoughts in the way of making the best decision.

Some people have experienced the same situation as you, and their past decision can help you make the better choice. We can learn from their mistake or build off their previous choice. Again, the only way to learn these stories is to ask more than one person for advice. People that base their advice from what they have experienced normally have a good reason for a certain solution. People do have different experiences, though. This is important to know so that we can see the differences and similarities of their past. Their opinion might strengthen your own and give a reason to choose a different option.

We all want to make the right choice when we come across a problem. The only way to do this is to ask multiple people for advice.

116050,5267676,5B55BC4B128C,train,"Dear State Senator,

I disagree with the Electoral College and believe we, the voters, should be souly responsible for determining our President. The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of our state. When we vote for something, we want our vote to determine our President, not determine who our electors will vote for.

When a member of their party votes, they may not always vote for that particular party's candidate. For instance, if the Democratic elect for 2016 had an aspect he planned to bring to Washington D.C., that a member of the Democratic party didn't agree with, they should be able to vote for whoever they please. Same goes for the electors, who may swing to the opposite party that particular year.

In the case of a tie, I do however agree that it should then be up to state senators to take into consideration both candidates and go over their key aspects. Then they can choice what will be most beneficial to our country and what will in the long run help our great state and country as well.

I do not think their should be swing states. I think that the exact votes of the citizens should be counted and go only on that. It should not matter the state or region the voter is in. Instead of voters supmitting a ballot at the local voting site, I think the voter should be able to vote online at a local voting center. In the past, voting has got miss-counted and I think that a more accurate means of voting would be to do it online. That way papers cannot get lost and a computer can count vote so human error does not occur.

I also highly agree with the statement from paragraph 23 that states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state..."" This is true with states particularly in the North who are made up of mostly Democratic and the South being mainly Republican. After the decisions made by the current president Obama, I think many Democratics will want to try something different after seeing all that has not been accomplished under Obama as of 2015.

Students at our school should be able to play the sports they play, even if the student has a low grade. The student could continue playing sports through college, and maybe have a successful career in sports. Students should at least be able to play a sport with any grade, because it does not matter about how their grades are, they should be good in the sports they play in. For example: Lets say my friend has a low grade, just one. You shouldn't kick him off of whatever sport he plays, because, what would he think of the school then? And the student would be really upset, as he was just kicked off his sports team, because of one bad grade. This new policy would be very unfair to girls and boys who play sports, because what would the child say to their parent? The parent of the child would be really upset, because their child was kicked off of the sport they were playing. If many of the students have a C grade average, the student with the grade should still be able to play on their sports team. If I was kicked off my sports team, just for having on C on my report card, I would tell my parents and they would not be happy. My parents would want me to do good in school, too, but sports give students something to do, rather than sit at their houses, waiting for dad or mom to come home from work. Sports are a good education for any kid, and taking away what they do best, whether it be tossing a football, or playing lacrosse. What I am saying is, if you take a kid away from sports, he is basically being pulled from more education, as sports can have strategies just like math can. Sports are good to do after school, as the students can relax sometimes and just enjoy being kids. Sports can make a kid more muscular, and sports can also use some tactics that are sometimes used in math. When the kids go home, then they can do their homework, and relax after the homework is done. Kids are learning some great things from sports and the students could get a career in sports, because they played sports so much in school. Principals should not ban kids from their sports just because they did not get one single good grade. This would not be a fair policy to me, as if the whole school had at least one C average, and the whole school played sports, wouldn't that be a little harsh kicking every student off of their sports teams? Sports can help reduce stress at times, like football. If a kid is having a bad day, and he has a football game tonight, he could tackle somebody and feel better. Just keep in mind that, if the whole school had at least one C average on their report cards, it would not be fair to just ban kids from their sports, because a lot of people play sports, and you just can't kick everyone off of their teams, because this would be very unfair.",4,1617040000000.0,394,664,"For example: Lets say my friend has a low grade, just one.

It should be all about the people and what they want and who they want as the leader of the country not who the Electoral College puts in the office. Also the Electoral College is a process not a place but their are people that run the Electoral College and they put in who they want and not who the people want.

The counting of the electoral votes is done by Congress. Also the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. ""In Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, youd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" The votes would go to be electoral votes instead of what the people. Someone can be voted in to office by the peoples vote but it has to be that the other person might get in by the electoral votes instead of the individual votes.

The electoral vote overrule the peoples votes. For example ""Obama received 61.7 precent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percentof the popular votes cast for him and Romney."" It just is not fair for the people to vote for who they want as president and the Electoral College puts who they want in instead who people want in office. The people want who they want not who you put in office. In the state of Florida there are 29 electoral votes, Texas there are 38, California has 55.

These are reasons why the Electoral College should be changed to the election of the popular votes. It is only fair to do that instead of having it as someone that the people did not want in office.

Limiting this extensive car use can benefit everyone by allowing him or her to be happy and reduce pollution.

To begin, limiting reliance on vehicles may help people become happier. In Vaubun, Germany, many have sold their vehicles and are now walking or biking to their destinations. Some parents felt that when they had a car, ""[they were] always tense."" (1) Instead of allowing themselves to be outside and free to move, they were trapped inside a small space. Now, they have the freedom to enjoy scenery, without a cost. In Bogota, Colombia, people hold an annual ""car-free day"". This event bans the use of any vehicle besides public buses and taxis. (3) ""The turnout was large, despite... [the] rain showers. [The rain] hasn't stopped people from participating."" (3) This shows that the citizens of Bogota are eager to attend such an event that prevents them of using their vehicles. Many believe this event is a ""good oppurtunity to take away stress"". (3) The event forces them to take a walk or get on their bike, without the stress of gas or tune-ups. Young adults in the United States believe that [getting a driver's license is] not a priority. They organize summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation."" (4) This implies that they know walking is not as bad as it seems, and they do not need to rely on a car to get to places. Ultimately, this reduction of vehicle dependence can lead to less stress and a rise in happiness.

Futhermore, reducing the usage of cars may help reduce pollution. In Paris, France, people have experienced ""near-record pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air"".(2) This experience included smog, a very dense layer of water and pollution particles. This air is very dangerous to breathe and live in. ""[In this city, sixty-seven] percent of vehicles [use diesel]."" (2) Diesel is a heavier than gasoline, and is blamed for a large percentage of pollution. The ban alternates the usage of vehicles; even-numbered plates go one day, odd-numbered the next. This process is sought to cut the usage and emission of pollutants in half. Walking, biking, using public transportation, etc. help reduce pollution because they are services given or provided to everyone. Walking and biking do not emit harmful pollutants. Buses allow people to commute along with other people, but stop anywhere you want. Using these services instead of self-owned vehicles will help reduce pollution.

All in all, cars are handy for going miles and miles on end, but restricting car use to go to the store or down the street can help people become happier and reduce pollution.

Some people ask more than one person for there advice, so they can weight there options. The advice I go to my friends for are Clothes, Nail Polish, and Hair. Those are just a couple but those are the major ones.

The first reason I go to my friends for advice is Clothes. Some clothes are cute but some are to cropped for me. I ask my friends if this would look good on me. Some of the stuff does but, some doesn't. Also if my clothes match. I send them the outfit that I am wearing and get there opinions. most of the time my clothes match. It is just when I am unsure about it matching that I send it to them.

Another reason I go to my friends for advice is Nail Polish. Nail Polish is hard to pick from because they have so many beautiful colors. When I am choosing I send the colors that I like the most and the glitter, if I am feeling a glitter that day,. After I send them, they text me the ones they like and then I choose between those that they choose, or the ones that got choose the most. once i have them then i try then out on a piece of my finger so then i will know if they are darken then the bottle says or litter. On another piece of that same finger nail i make sure the Nail Polishes look good together.

The final reason I go to my friends for advice is Hair. I ask this question a lot, if my hair looks good ?. The reason I do that is because I try new hair styles, and I wear them to school so i ask people if I look good with it.

For example, I learned how to french braid and i wore it to school. All day people were asking me to do there hair. so i guess it looked good.

My conclusion is that when people ask for advice you should answer it and help them out. I help people out when they come to me. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. If you are that person then you are a important person to them.

46259,AAAXMP138200000810972850_OR,D8406ADB1493,train,"Some principals have decided that all students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity whether it be sports, yearbook club, or serve on student council. Extracurricular activities can be fun for students that have free time after school and sometimes before school to participate in the schools events. Extracurricular activities like sports can keep students in shape and even improve students social life. Clubs and student council can also improve students social life. However, students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because not only is school enough by itself, but students also need time for homework, family time, and time to get rest.

When students participate in extracurricular activities, they need to find a way to balance time between that and homework. Some students are not able to do that which is why they should not participate in extracurricular activities. Homework is important because it helps understand what is taught in class. If students rush through the homework as the teacher is collecting it in class, the students will not benefit from it. Not doing your homework will not only effect what you are learning in the class but it will also effect your grade if it is not done.

Also, when students participate in extracurricular activities, there are many reasons why it is important for them to have time with their families too. First, not having time with their families will effect them mentally and emotionally, because this may cause students to feel lonely. Next, not having family time may also upset their parents because the student may have a younger sibling or cousin that needs to be babysat. Last but not least, students may have a loved one that is in the hospital and if a student has to participate in an activity, they may regret not spending time with that person. Students may end up too tired to socialize with their families or go visit a loved one in the hospital when they are done with sports practice or a club meeting.

When participating in extracurricular activities, it may be hard to find time to get a good nights rest between finding time for homework, family, and school. It is important for students to have time to get a long rest every night because they need it to stay focused in class, sleep is required to have a positive attitude, and students need a good amount of rest each night to be healthy overall. If students do not have enough sleep every night, they may fall asleep in class and their grade will drop. Also, if students do not have enough rest, their mental, emotional, and physical health will suffer and they may not be able to participate in their extracurricular activity to the best of their ability. If the student is not able to do their best in the club or sport, there is no purpose in having them included in it.

Children should have a choice in school when it comes to participating in extracurricular activities because they need time to complete school work, they need bonding time with their loved ones, and they need time to sleep. It is important for principals to take all of these reasons into consideration before they decide to make all of their students participate in an extracurricular activity. If the student does not want to do the activity then they will not work to their best ability to be successful in it anyways. No student should be forced into doing something that they do not want to do when it comes to outside of school work and learning. ",5,1616440000000.0,697,821,"

63943,AAATRP14318000158140,F5FFB56CDD7B,train,"The use of the new technology, the Facial Action Coding System, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is not valuable. It should be used exclusively for educational purposes and to help students gain knowledge on their studies in school.

This new computer software that can detect emotions should not be used on students, but on other material. Although I do not believe this is a valuable system to use on people, I believe it is valuable for people to use for educational purposes. For example, if students are examining a piece of artwork in art class and need to examine, or would like to determine, the true expression of a person's face in the artwork, this system could be used for that. If students wanted to go more in-depth and figure out specific percentages for each of the person in the painting's expressions, they could also use this system. The text reads, ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This was figured out by using the Facial Action Coding System on the painting of Mona Lisa, which determined careful, specific percentages of each of her emotions shown in her portrait, all within her neutral facial expression. I believe this system should be used in the classroom, exclusively for students' education and for examining certain material, such as artwork.

I believe there are better, more educational uses for the Facial Action Coding System than to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. This system could be used for students interested in, or participating in, a technology class. The text reads, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" The video imagery would be incredibly valuable to a student working with technology as a way to capture careful movements and detect emotions of artwork or another educational source. The text also reads, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" I believe students, especially ones working with technology, should be able to use this system, as it would be a valuable tool to use if they were to examine or study this process. It is important that this system is used correctly; to help students with their education and expand their knowledge on subjects in school, such as technology.

I do not believe the use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for detecting students' emotional expressions. It has better uses, such as for close examinations of artwork, research, and statistics. I feel as if students do not need a system to ""de-code"" our emotions, as students are typically able to fully express theirs on their own. Although it may be difficult to detect certain emotions of a student and encourage them to fully express them, I feel it is necessary to keep it that way, in respect for the student. The text reads, ""classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" which I firmly believe is not useful, nor valuable. Typically, those six basic emotions are easiIy detected by humans and do not require a computer system. I do not believe a computer software system should determine students' emotions, let alone any humans', unless they would personally like to use it. I think of the Facial Action Coding System as more or a toy, if it is used to detect human's expressions rather than an educational material's expressions, such as a piece of artwork.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. This system should be used for educational purposes, whether it is used for close examination of a person in an artworks' expression, or for research or statistics in technology.

As a student invests his time and effort in each activity, it can be quite vexatious for him to prioritize school over other important activities and responsibilities that need his undivided attention. However, if a student had the opportunity to take online courses or video conferencing, he could prioritize his responsibilities and continue to make time for learning; for example, if a student has to work during the day time, he can focus on his online classes or video conferences after work or during breaks. All in all, taking classes from home will be flexible towards a student's schedule.

Attending classes from home can be beneficial to students as it can also de-stress the students when working from home. A plethora of students feel that a major part of their stress comes from school and its environment. The environment consists of two factors that can stress out a student: competition and high expectations. Some students have the need to make other students feel subordinate with their intricate knowledge, which creates competition within their grade level. The students also feel pressured by teachers and parents to earn straight A's and be the best in their grade level. Over time, the two factors cause students to jeopardize their mental and physical health as they are in situations that lead them to stress; students end up feeling burnt out. On the contrary, working from home eliminates the competition and decreases the high expectations since the online classes taken individually and the one-on-one video conferences create no competition at the students' homes; moreover, teachers will not be present to ensure that the students are meeting the teacher's expectations. Although parents will continue to expect the students to do well, the students will continue to work at their own pace in the comfort of their own home; therefore, working from home will decrease the stress of the student.

Overall, if a student decides to take classes from home, he will gain several benefits. Attending classes from home can be beneficial to students due to flexible scheduling and de-stressing. With a flexible work schedule, students can prioritize other activities and responsibilities while they can also make time to prioritize school. Working from home can also lift the stress of students' shoulders since they won't be competing with anyone else for the highest grade; furthermore, they will not be pressured to have perfect grades by teachers. In spite the different learning environment as opposed to the school environment most students experience, distance learning is an opportunity offered to students where they work from home through online courses or video conferences. ",5,1621870000000.0,1518,2723,"A plethora of students feel that a major part of their stress comes from school and its environment.

I think student should be able to help do community service because, we should keep out community clean and help out people that is in need. Its an good idea to help out our community cause without our help our community would look trashy and dirty, for example the side walk is always fell with trash, help keep it clean by bringing people along and clean it up am sure that will make them have something to do. People will think that we don't take care of our community like we should if we don't.

Another reason why i think students should help out our community is because many people don't have homes to go to and we need to help them out by for instant donating food for the food pantry, donating old clothes that you don't need, and more. We need to keep our community looking good and experience.

Helping our community will make you feel good about your self and helping somebody out will make you feel like you have achieve something in life. From my experience helping your community will make you a better person in life and you could feel that you have done something important for your community.

Finally students should be able to help our community out cause it will help them in school by bring their grades up or by getting an award from your principal. So don't waste time playing and goofing around when somebody is in need, go a head an help them out am sure they will feel thankful that you have done something.

That is why I think students should help our community.

When I got there and started doing what i was suppost to do I started enjoying it.

A reason I did is because I knew I was doing the right thing by helping with there community and just helping them with some little things also. Another reason is that when I went their I got to explore the acropolis in Greece and it was beautiful I think you would like it to. I also got a ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. I also went to china! It was very fun and so is being a Seagoing Cowboy. I also learned alot from it like we dont have to worry if we are going to get what we want for breakfast because some people that are less fortunate dont even have Three meals a day. It was hard to take that in but it deffinetly changed my whole point of view in life. I hope that if you give being a Seagoing Cowboy a shot that it would change your point of view in life also.

You should give it a try and see if you like it. If you do not like it you do not have to do it but if you do like it i suggest you do it more often, it is helping out and it is doing the right thing.

No, I believe it would be too troublesome for just a classroom full of students trying to learn. For example, some students wouldn't want the sensor to scan their face for some stupid reason.

Reson 1 on why I say no. The artical may state """"A classrom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"""", but that is about where the effectiveness of using this tech in classrooms stops.

Reason 2 on why I say no. This tech can be used in court or in buisneses. If someone is lying in court, we would know and could ask for the truth. With buisnes, you could tell if someone is impressed with your quota or idea then branch off from there.

148916,AAAXMP138200001414162125_OR,552E1E612147,train,"Students face many challenges while in school. These challenges might be a test, a quiz, or a sport that they play for the school. However, one of the biggest problems that students face that is not often talked about is catching up on work after missing many days of school. It is stressful, difficult, and time consuming to try and complete all of this missing work from not being at school. This could be easily changed with the formation of a distance learning program. Distance learning would be very beneficial to students because it would allow students to learn while at home sick, learn while traveling, and it would let people who would prefer to learn from home still get the proper education needed to be successful.

The first reason as to why distance learning would benefit students is for when a student is sick and does not feel good enough to make it to school. Most of the time when a student gets sick, they do not go to school because they do not feel good. That being said, there are also many students who will still go to school despite being sick because they don't want to miss anything and get behind on work. If distance learning was offered, students would not feel the need to attend school when they are not feeling well and could just learn all of the material from at home. Of course, there are some circumstances where a student is just too sick to do anything and will not be able to focus or learn, but the majority of students absent on a daily basis is because of sickness. Also, implementing distance learning would not only help the student who is sick, but the students and teachers all around him or her. That means that this distance learning program would not only benefit students who are missing school, but also the students who are still in school. The teachers would also be sick less often, and it would make things easier for them since they won't have to worry about getting their students all caught up to date. Implementing a distance learning program would certainly help students who are out with sickness.

Another reason why distance learning would be a benefit is because it allows students who are on vacation or out of town to learn. The second leading reason as to why students miss days of school is because they are out of town. This could be for sports, a family reunion, vacation, and so many other reasons. One specific example that relates to many students are sports. Many students miss games due to tournaments that are far away, and require a hotel for an overnight stay wherever this tournament or game is located. If distance learning was an option, students would be less stressed about the work that they are about to receive when getting back to school and can just do it when not playing. Another big reason for students missing school is vacation. This is where distance learning would benefit students the most. A student could be across the world traveling and learning about new places while still learning about the material necessary in school. This would allow for students to learn more about the world. This will make students going forward smarter. Distance learning would be beneficial for students who are traveling so they can learn from afar.

The last reason why distance learning would be beneficial is because it would allow students who would rather school from home get a good education. There are many reasons as to why a student would prefer to learn from at home. Some people may have social anxiety, and others may just not want to learn in a school environment. Offering distance learning would help these students learn while in their home. This would make students more comfortable, and usually when a student isn't stressed and comfortable, they perform better. This would increase test scores across the country and increase the knowledge of students across the country. Students would benefit from distance learning if they prefer to learn from at home.

Students face a lot of adversity throughout their time in school. Not only are students trying to maintain good grades and a good grade point average, but there are many distractions. Offering distance learning would just make it easier for students to complete their work on time and not have any overload of work. Students would benefit from distance learning because they can learn while they are at home sick, out of town, or simply just prefer to learn from at home.",5,1621830000000.0,880,1511,"Most of the time when a student gets sick, they do not go to school because they do not feel good.

I feel like driverless cars are dangerous, unreliable, and not affordable. This article made me feel like it is even more unsafe than I orginally thought. I feel like it is unsafe for people to be in a car that does not have a driver, because of it's limited abilities and how little technology there is for it.

I think that having a driverless car is dangerous because of its limited abilities. The article said that driverless cars can not navigate through work zones and around accidents or pull in and out the driveway. If the person in the driver seat were to fall asleep at the wheel or be completely distracted how would vibrating their chair and flashing light get their attention. The technology could malfunction and that is extremely dangerous. Imagine being in the passenger seat going 60 MPH on a highway and you have a gaming device or are watching TV in your car, and then out of no where you wrecked into something else. You had no warning or no advisery that you were in a dangerous situation because that technology failed you and just caused a crash. The only solution that could possibly work is for manufactures to have cameras in the car watching the driver that is a positive. It could also be a negative based off of how it is a invasion of privacy. The smart roads would help in these situations but would cost to much money so it's practially eliminated.

Having a driverless car is plain out unreliable. If everyone has a driverless car the roads would be filled with computers and technology controlling every move and turn on the roads. Just one thing could go wrong and there could be a serveral car accidet or someones life could just have been taken. What if the steering starts acting up and it can stay in the right lane and another car has a driver who isn't paying attention then they collide. All that happened just because a car steering started messing up. Something even worse could happen for example the brakes stop working. Imagine going the speed limit down the street but someone was speeding and just got in a accident right in front of you. The seats start vibrating so you wake up and see the situation in time and try to hit the brakes and it didn't work. That would've caused another accident based off of it's unreliability with its technology. The coordination system could mess up and you end up somewhere completely off target then what you were expecting to be. All the unpredictable factors that make driverless cars unpredictable just overweight the postives of a car driving you because you don't feel like driving.

It could be to expensive for everyone to get a self driving car. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have self driving cars by 2020. The question is will be able to afford the car or be able to pay the insurance. Most cars are expensive but afforadble over a course of years because you pay a monthly payment.

How would you even be able to pay for it to get fix, the thing is you would not be able too. It might be to expensive for the average person.

I think it just is not smart to have self driving cars on the roads. It is to hazardest for people to mainly rely off of it when anything could go wrong. They are trying to make it more safe by putting in cameras, or vibrating seats, and entertainment to keep you away. That's all positive stuff but that doesn't mean it is realistic. There is no promise that any of that could do what it is expected to do. I think we should just stick to people driving cars for a better and safer driving experience on the road.
