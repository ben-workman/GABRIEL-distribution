Importantly, 'search engine', 'integrated circuit', and 'SSRIs' would instead belong in the 'specific technology' class, because they are not products of a specific company.

For example, 'Bessemer process', 'assembly line', 'interchangeable parts', various mining and agricultural practices, and so on would be classified as 'tech process' because they were not specific technologies but technological methodologies of manufacturing, service, or agriculture which were invented.
